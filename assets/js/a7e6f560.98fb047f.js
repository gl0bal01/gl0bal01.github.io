Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic.

Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks.

The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from companies victimized by data theft.\\nU.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo \u2014 U.K. resident Thalha Jubair \u2014\xa0who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against Marks & Spencer and Harrods, the British food retailer Co-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions at MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.\\n\\nA Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Teenagers.\u201d\\n\\nIn August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida man Noah Michael Urban was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.\\nIn April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member was extradited from Spain to the U.S., where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allege\xa0Tyler Robert Buchanan\xa0and co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims.\\nUpdate, Oct. 8, 8:59 a.m. ET: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the malware sent by the reader as a Windows screenshot file. Rather, it is a Windows screensaver file.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/#comments","description":"A cybercriminal group that used voice phishing attacks to siphon more than a billion records from Salesforce customers earlier this year has launched a website that threatens to publish data stolen from dozens of Fortune 500 firms if they refuse to pay a ransom.

Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.</p>\\n<p>In the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing &#8212; and very often bragging about &#8212; serious cybercrime offenses.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Here we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;Most get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they&#8217;re released.</p>\\n<p>Indeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;What we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;The members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Nixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;If law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,&#8221; she said.</p>\\n<p><em>The Times of London</em> <a href=\\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/teenagers-charged-tfl-cyberattack-scattered-spider-trdhs5rwf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">reports</a> that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.\\nAt a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled Transport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.\\n\\nA court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity reported that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider ransom attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group.\\nThat story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group\u2019s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.\\nThe story also noted that Jubair\u2019s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair\u2019s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.\\nEARLY DAYS (2021-2022)\\nJubair is alleged to have been a core member of the LAPSUS$\xa0cybercrime group that\xa0broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including\xa0Microsoft,\xa0Nvidia,\xa0Okta,\xa0Rockstar Games,\xa0Samsung,\xa0T-Mobile, and\xa0Uber.\\nThat is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames Amtrak\xa0and\xa0Asyntax. In the middle of the gang\u2019s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\\nThe leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax\u2019s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:\\n\\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair\u2019s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\\n\\n\\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including \u201cEverlynn,\u201d who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d\xa0targeting the major social media and email providers.\\nIn these so-called \u201cfake EDR\u201d schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\\n\\nThe roster of the now-defunct \u201cInfinity Recursion\u201d hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder \u201cEverlynn\u201d has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as \u201cPeter\u201d became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair\u2019s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$\u2019s chat channel.\\n\\n\\nEARTHTOSTAR\\nProsecutors in New Jersey last week alleged Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, 0ktapus, and UNC3944, and that he used the nicknames EarthtoStar, Brad, Austin, and Austistic.\\nBeginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called Star Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nJubair allegedly used the handle \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.\\n\\nThe group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target\u2019s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim\u2019s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.\\nIn February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with \u201cTmo up!\u201d and \u201cTmo down!\u201d notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile\u2019s network.\\n\\nA redacted receipt from Star Chat\u2019s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.\\n\\nThe data showed that Star Chat \u2014 along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time \u2014 collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.\\n\\nThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.\\n\\nA review of EarthtoStar\u2019s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint shows this person also sold \u201cAT&T email resets\u201d and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:\\n\u201cOk people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says \u20182fa required\u2019 or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?\u201d\\n\\nNew Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022 that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer\u2019s Okta authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.\\nThe phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.\\nThat weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, Plex and Signal.\\n\\nA visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.\\n\\nDA, COMRADE\\nEarthtoStar\u2019s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel \u201cFrauwudchat\u201d:\\n\u201cHi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API\u2019s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.\u201d\\n\\nAt around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat \u2014 \u201cRocketAce\u201d and \u201cLopiu\u201d \u2014 introduced the group\u2019s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit, including:\\n-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;\\n\\nThe user \u201cLopiu\u201d on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.\\n\\nThese two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar\u2019s many aliases, posted to Exploit:\\nHello. I have access to a telecommunications company\u2019s citrix and vpn.

Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair\u2019s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.\\nThe complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida man charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.\\nUrban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.\\n\\nNoah \u201cKingbob\u201d Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.\\n\\nA\xa0court transcript (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban\u2019s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.\\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B, and easily one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.\\nIn the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing \u2014 and very often bragging about \u2014 serious cybercrime offenses.\\n\u201cHere we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cMost get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d\\nNixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they\u2019re released.\\nIndeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.\\n\u201cWhat we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.\u201d\\nNixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.\\n\u201cIf law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,\u201d she said.\\nThe Times of London reports that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.\\nJubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.\\nIn the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. If extradited to the U.S., tried and convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison.\\nIn July 2025, the United Kingdom barred victims of hacking from paying ransoms to cybercriminal groups unless approved by officials. U.K. organizations that are considered part of critical infrastructure reportedly will face a complete ban, as will the entire public sector. U.K. victims of a hack are now required to notify officials to better inform policymakers on the scale of Britain\u2019s ransomware problem.\\nFor further reading (bless you), check out Bloomberg\u2019s poignant story last week based on a year\u2019s worth of jailhouse interviews with convicted Scattered Spider member Noah Urban.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/feds-tie-scattered-spider-duo-to-115m-in-ransoms/#comments","description":"U.S. prosecutors last week levied criminal hacking charges against 19-year-old U.K. national Thalha Jubair for allegedly being a core member of Scattered Spider, a prolific cybercrime group blamed for extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from victims.

It\u2019s designed to feel urgent and personal so you tap before you think. The whole funnel is built for phones: big tap targets, short copy, sticky chat bubbles\u2014perfect for someone arriving straight from TikTok.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks to our community for spotting this one. This exact scam was shared on our Malwarebytes subreddit by user Ok-Internal-2110, who posted a warning for TikTok users after encountering it firsthand.\\nI walked through the flow so you don\u2019t have to.\\nWhat the site shows vs. what actually exists\\nThe illusion:\\nThe moment you log in with the credentials from that TikTok DM, a glossy, mobile-friendly dashboard flashes a huge balance. There\u2019s motion (numbers \u201cupdate\u201d), a believable \u201chistory,\u201d and a big Withdraw button right where your thumb expects it. On a small screen, it looks like a real account with real money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trap:\\nWhen you try to send that balance to your own wallet, the site asks for a withdrawal key belonging to the original account holder\u2014the one from the DM. You don\u2019t have that key, and support won\u2019t give it to you. External withdrawals are a dead end by design.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe detour they push you to take:\\nSupport suggests using Internal Transfer instead. Conveniently, they also offer to help you create a new user \u201cin seconds,\u201d and this new account will have its own key (because you created it). That makes it feel like you\u2019re finally doing something legitimate: \u201cI\u2019ll just transfer the funds to my new account and then withdraw.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paywall you only meet once you\u2019re invested:\\nInternal transfers only work on \u201cVIP\u201d accounts. To upgrade to VIP, you must pay for a membership. Many victims pay here, assuming it\u2019s a one-time hurdle before they can finally withdraw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy nothing real ever leaves the site:\\nAfter you upgrade and attempt the internal transfer, the site can:\\ndemand another fee (a \u201climit lift,\u201d \u201ctax,\u201d or \u201csecurity key\u201d),\\nfail silently and push you to support, or\\n\u201ccomplete\u201d the transfer inside the fake ledger while still blocking any external withdrawal.\\nVictims end up paying for the privilege of moving fake numbers between fake accounts\u2014then paying again to \u201cunlock\u201d a withdrawal that never happens.\\nThe scam in a nutshell\\nThis scam is built for volume.

How mindset shapes risk: overconfident and under-protected\\nSeven in ten extortion victims say they\u2019re confident they can spot a scam, more than half believe they could recoup any financial losses, and most trust their phone\u2019s safety features. At the same time, many victims and targets simply don\u2019t worry about mobile scams at all, resulting in a lack of protective measures. Adoption of security basics (security software, strong/unique passwords, multi-factor authentication, timely system updates, permission hygiene, data backups) remains low, even after painful firsthand experience. \\nHow to cut the risk\\nMost of us use our phones to shop, find deals, and pay\u2014and we deserve to be able to do that safely. Adopting preventative security measures (such as using mobile security software), practicing good mobile hygiene (such as checking app permissions), and remembering STOP, our simple scam response framework, can keep scammers at bay:\xa0\\nS\u2014Slow down: Don\u2019t let urgency or pressure push you into action. Take a breath before responding. Legitimate businesses like your bank or credit card don\u2019t push immediate action.\\nT\u2014Test them: If you answered the phone and are feeling panicked about the situation, likely involving a family member or friend, ask a question only the real person would know\u2014something that can\u2019t be found online.\xa0\xa0\\nO\u2014Opt out: If it feels off, hang up or end the conversation. You can always say the connection dropped.\\nP\u2014Prove it: Confirm the person is who they say they are by reaching out yourself through a trusted number, website, or method you\u2019ve used before.\\nThe criminals behind extortion scams pour time and money into targeting their victims, constantly evolving their tactics to make the scams more believable and hard-hitting. If you\u2019ve been the victim of an extortion scam, sharing your story can help others spot the signs before it\u2019s too late, reduce the stigma of being a victim, and put the shame where it belongs: on the criminals.\\nAs Malwarebytes Global Head of Scam and AI Research Shahak Shalev puts it:\\n\u201cIf we can remove the stigma and silence around scams, I think we can help everyone take a step back and pause before acting on one of these threats\u201d\\nWe don\u2019t just report on scams\u2014we help detect them\\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\nVideo footage of the assault taken by The LA Ten Four shows the man being punched, kicked and stomped on by several others. At least two of the attackers appear to be wearing SoCal Active Club t-shirts, identifiable as such by photos and videos posted from the vigil.\\n\\nA frame from video footage filmed by LA Ten Four of the assault, showing one of several men wearing shirts with SoCal Active Club\u2019s logo; the individual second from right of the photo in the SoCal Active Club t-shirt can be seen in the video kicking the man on the ground. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\n\\nFrames from a video posted by Patriot Front, and shared by the main Active Club Telegram channel, showing several individuals wearing the same SoCal Active Club t-shirts at the same event before the alleged assault.\\nSoCal Active Club has not responded to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment on their apparent involvement in this assault as of publication.\\nWiley D.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat.

No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d.

Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right).

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions.

It turns out that just 13 percent globally are actually prepared for the AI revolution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, this small group \u2013 which Cisco calls the &#8216;Pacesetters&#8217; \u2013 are lapping the competition. The third annual Cisco AI Readiness Index found these top performers are four times more likely to get their AI projects out of the pilot stage and into the real world. More importantly, they are 50 percent more likely to see measurable value from their efforts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What they&#8217;ve figured out is that winning with AI is about getting the foundations right with a disciplined approach that weaves together strategy, infrastructure, and security. And it pays off, with 90 percent of these Pacesetters seeing real gains in profit, productivity, and innovation, while most of their peers are hovering around the 60 percent mark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s President and Chief Product Officer, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s Cisco AI Readiness Index makes one thing clear: AI doesn\u2019t fail, readiness fails.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201cThe most AI-ready organisations \u2013 the Pacesetters from our research \u2013 prove it. They\u2019re four times more likely to move pilots into production and 50 percent more likely to realise measurable value. So, with more than 80 percent of organisations we surveyed about to deploy AI agents, these new findings confirm readiness, discipline, and action are key to unlocking value.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, what\u2019s their secret? The research shows a clear pattern. Pacesetters don\u2019t treat AI as a side project; it&#8217;s a core part of their business strategy. Almost every single one of them (99%) has a proper AI roadmap, something only 58 percent of other companies can claim. They also put their money where their mouth is. For 79 percent of them, AI is the top investment priority, a commitment shared by only 24 percent of the rest.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These leaders are building for the long haul, with 98 percent designing their networks to handle the immense scale and complexity of AI, compared to just 46 percent of their peers. It gives them the confidence that their systems can handle whatever is thrown at them; 71 percent say their networks can scale instantly for any AI project, a feeling shared by a worryingly low 15 percent of other organisations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The report also gives us a glimpse into the near future, and for many, it looks rocky. Two huge challenges are looming: the widespread use of AI agents and a problem Cisco has dubbed &#8216;AI Infrastructure Debt&#8217;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>83 percent of companies are planning to deploy AI agents as part of their strategy, with nearly 40 percent expecting them to be working alongside human employees within a year. But here\u2019s the problem: most of these firms are trying to build on shaky ground.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over half of companies admitted their current networks simply can&#8217;t handle the data volumes or complexity that these advanced AI systems demand. The Pacesetters, on the other hand, have already done their homework, with 75 percent feeling fully equipped to secure and control these agents, compared to just 31 percent of others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This leads us to the ticking time bomb of \u2018AI Infrastructure Debt\u2019. Think of it as the modern version of the technical debt that plagued companies for years. It\u2019s the result of all the compromises, postponed upgrades, and underfunded plans that quietly pile up, slowly strangling the long-term value of AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The warning signs are already flashing.

It turns out that just 13 percent globally are actually prepared for the AI revolution.\\nHowever, this small group \u2013 which Cisco calls the \u2018Pacesetters\u2019 \u2013 are lapping the competition. The third annual Cisco AI Readiness Index found these top performers are four times more likely to get their AI projects out of the pilot stage and into the real world. More importantly, they are 50 percent more likely to see measurable value from their efforts.\\nWhat they\u2019ve figured out is that winning with AI is about getting the foundations right with a disciplined approach that weaves together strategy, infrastructure, and security. And it pays off, with 90 percent of these Pacesetters seeing real gains in profit, productivity, and innovation, while most of their peers are hovering around the 60 percent mark.\\nJeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s President and Chief Product Officer, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s Cisco AI Readiness Index makes one thing clear: AI doesn\u2019t fail, readiness fails.\\n\u201cThe most AI-ready organisations \u2013 the Pacesetters from our research \u2013 prove it. They\u2019re four times more likely to move pilots into production and 50 percent more likely to realise measurable value. So, with more than 80 percent of organisations we surveyed about to deploy AI agents, these new findings confirm readiness, discipline, and action are key to unlocking value.\u201d\xa0\\nSo, what\u2019s their secret? The research shows a clear pattern. Pacesetters don\u2019t treat AI as a side project; it\u2019s a core part of their business strategy. Almost every single one of them (99%) has a proper AI roadmap, something only 58 percent of other companies can claim. They also put their money where their mouth is. For 79 percent of them, AI is the top investment priority, a commitment shared by only 24 percent of the rest.\\nThese leaders are building for the long haul, with 98 percent designing their networks to handle the immense scale and complexity of AI, compared to just 46 percent of their peers. It gives them the confidence that their systems can handle whatever is thrown at them; 71 percent say their networks can scale instantly for any AI project, a feeling shared by a worryingly low 15 percent of other organisations.\\nThe report also gives us a glimpse into the near future, and for many, it looks rocky. Two huge challenges are looming: the widespread use of AI agents and a problem Cisco has dubbed \u2018AI Infrastructure Debt\u2019.\\n83 percent of companies are planning to deploy AI agents as part of their strategy, with nearly 40 percent expecting them to be working alongside human employees within a year. But here\u2019s the problem: most of these firms are trying to build on shaky ground.\\nOver half of companies admitted their current networks simply can\u2019t handle the data volumes or complexity that these advanced AI systems demand. The Pacesetters, on the other hand, have already done their homework, with 75 percent feeling fully equipped to secure and control these agents, compared to just 31 percent of others.\\nThis leads us to the ticking time bomb of \u2018AI Infrastructure Debt\u2019. Think of it as the modern version of the technical debt that plagued companies for years. It\u2019s the result of all the compromises, postponed upgrades, and underfunded plans that quietly pile up, slowly strangling the long-term value of AI.\\nThe warning signs are already flashing. Nearly two-thirds of leaders expect their workloads to jump by over 30 percent in the next three years, and a similar number are struggling just to get their data organised in one place. Add to that the fact that only a quarter have enough GPU power, and you see a massive gap between ambition and reality.\\nThe lesson from Cisco\u2019s report is clear and simple: value follows readiness. In the race to adopt AI, the Pacesetters have shown that the organisations that take the time to build a strong foundation to support their strategy are the ones that will pull away from the pack.\\nSee also: Gemini Enterprise: Google aims to put an AI agent on every desk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

in your editor with that little gray box. It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on <em>real</em> repository context.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext-edit suggestions: Copilot predicts the next change you\u2019ll make and offers it inline.

We\u2019re talking about COBOL, a programming language that\u2019s been around for 65 years. That\u2019s older than the internet.\\nNow, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014COBOL isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, it\u2019s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.\\nThe problem? Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns. The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.\\nBut here\u2019s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.\\nMeet the developer who\u2019s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)\\nI recently spoke with Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who\u2019s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What\u2019s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.\\nJulia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn\u2019t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions. The COBOL experts provided the legacy system knowledge.\\nWhen this whole idea of Gen AI appeared, we were thinking about how we can actually use AI to solve this problem that has not been really solved yet.\\nJulia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt\\nThe three-step framework for AI-powered legacy modernization\\nJulia and her team at Microsoft have cracked the code (pun intended) with a systematic approach that works for any legacy modernization project, not just COBOL. Here\u2019s their GitHub Copilot powered, battle-tested framework.\\nStep 1: Code preparation (reverse engineering)\\nThe biggest problem with legacy systems? Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool. Instead of hiring consultants to spend months analyzing code, you can use AI to:\\nExtract business logic from legacy files.\\nDocument everything in markdown for human review.\\nAutomatically identify call chains and dependencies.\\nClean up irrelevant comments and historical logs.\\nAdd additional information as comments where needed.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Always have human experts review AI-generated analysis. AI is incredible at pattern recognition, but domain knowledge still matters for business context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s what GitHub Copilot generates for you:\xa0\\n# Business Logic Analysis Generated by GitHub Copilot\\n## File Inventory\\n- listings.cobol: List management functionality (~100 lines)\\n- mainframe-example.cobol: Full mainframe program (~10K lines, high complexity)\\n\\n## Business Purpose\\nCustomer account validation with balance checking\\n- Validates account numbers against master file\\n- Performs balance calculations with overdraft protection\\n- Generates transaction logs for audit compliance\\n\\n## Dependencies Discovered\\n- DB2 database connections via SQLCA\\n- External validation service calls\\n- Legacy print queue system\\nStep 2: Enrichment (making code AI-digestible)\\nYou usually need to add context to help AI understand your code better. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\\nTranslation: If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.\\nStructural analysis: COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you\u2019ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they\u2019re predictable. Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL\u2019s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.\\nDocumentation as source of truth: Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: \u201cEverything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.\u201d\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: COBOL\u2019s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation.

Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax.

Perhaps you started the same way: You opened GitHub Copilot, started asking questions in natural language, and hoped for a usable output. This approach can work for simple fixes and code suggestions, but as your needs get more complex\u2014or as your work gets more collaborative\u2014you\u2019re going to need a more foolproof strategy.\xa0\\nThis guide will introduce you to a three-part framework that transforms this ad-hoc style of AI experimentation into a repeatable and reliable engineering practice. At its core are two concepts: agentic primitives, which are reusable, configurable building blocks that enable AI agents to work systematically; and context engineering, which ensures your AI agents always focus on the right information. By familiarizing yourself with these concepts, you\u2019ll be able to build AI systems that can not only code independently, but do so reliably, predictably, and consistently.\\nThe AI-native development framework\\nMarkdown prompt engineering + agent primitives + context engineering = reliability\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re new to AI-native development or looking to bring deeper reliability to your agent workflows, this guide will give you the foundation you need to build, scale, and share intelligent systems that learn and improve with every use.\\n\ud83e\udde0 Try it yourself: Build and run agentic workflows with GitHub Copilot CLI\\nBring your agent primitives to life right from your terminal. The new GitHub Copilot CLI lets you run, debug, and automate AI workflows locally\u2014no setup scripts, no context loss. It connects directly to your repositories, pull requests, and issues through GitHub MCP, giving your agents the same context they\u2019d have in your IDE.\xa0\\n\ud83d\udc49 Get started with GitHub Copilot CLI >\\nWhat are agent primitives?\xa0\\nThe three-layer framework below turns ad-hoc AI experimentation into a reliable, repeatable process. It does this by combining the structure of Markdown; the power of agent primitives, simple building blocks that give your AI agents clear instructions and capabilities; and smart context management, so your agents always get the right information (not just more information).\xa0\\nLayer 1: Use Markdown for more strategic prompt engineering\\nWe\u2019ve written about the importance of prompt engineering. But here\u2019s what you need to know: The clearer, more precise, more context-rich your prompt, the better, more accurate your outcome. This is where Markdown comes in. With Markdown\u2019s structure (its headers, lists, and links), you can naturally guide AI\u2019s reasoning, making outputs more predictable and consistent.\xa0\\nTo provide a strong foundation for your prompt engineering, try these techniques with Markdown as your guide:\xa0\\nContext loading: [Review existing patterns](./src/patterns/). In this case, links become context injection points that pull in relevant information, either from files or websites.\\nStructured thinking: Use headers and bullets to create clear reasoning pathways for the AI to follow.\\nRole activation: Use phrases like \u201cYou are an expert [in this role].\u201d This triggers specialized knowledge domains and will focus the AI\u2019s responses.\\nTool integration: Use MCP tool tool-name. This lets your AI agent run code in a controlled, repeatable, and predictable way on MCP servers.\\nPrecise language: Eliminate ambiguity through specific instructions.\\nValidation gates: \u201cStop and get user approval.\u201d Make sure there is always human oversight at critical decision points.\\nFor example, instead of saying, Find and fix the bug, use the following:\\nYou are an expert debugger, specialized in debugging complex programming issues.\\n\\nYou are particularly great at debugging this project, which architecture and quirks can be consulted in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture.md). \\n\\nFollow these steps:\\n\\n1. Review the [error logs](./logs/error.log) and identify the root cause. \\n\\n2. Use the `azmcp-monitor-log-query` MCP tool to retrieve infrastructure logs from Azure.  \\n\\n3. Once you find the root cause, think about 3 potential solutions with trade-offs\\n\\n4. Present your root cause analysis and suggested solutions with trade-offs to the user and seek validation before proceeding with fixes - do not change any files.\\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable with structured prompting, you\u2019ll quickly realize that manually crafting perfect prompts for every task is unsustainable. (Who has the time?) This is where the second step comes in: turning your prompt engineering insights into reusable, configurable systems.\\nLayer 2: Agentic primitives: Deploying your new prompt engineering techniques\\nNow it\u2019s time to implement all of your new strategies more systematically, instead of prompting ad hoc. These configurable tools will help you do just that.\\nCore agent primitives\\nWhen it comes to AI-native development, a core agent primitive refers to a simple, reusable file or module that provides a specific capability or rule for an agent.\xa0\\nHere are some examples:\\nInstructions files: Deploy structured guidance through modular .instructions.md files with targeted scope. At GitHub, we offer custom instructions to give Copilot repository-specific guidance and preferences.\xa0\\nChat modes: Deploy role-based expertise through .chatmode.md files with MCP tool boundaries that prevent security breaches and cross-domain interference. For example, professional licenses that keep architects from building and engineers from planning.\\nAgentic workflows: Deploy reusable prompts through .prompt.md files with built-in validation.\\nSpecification files: Create implementation-ready blueprints through .spec.md files that ensure repeatable results, whether the work is done by a person or by AI.\\nAgent memory files: Preserve knowledge across sessions through .memory.md files.\\nContext helper files: Optimize information retrieval through .context.md files.\\nHow using a core agent primitive can transform a prompt and its outcome\\nTechnique: Using Markdown prompt engineering, your prompt can be: \u201cImplement secure user authentication system\u201d\xa0\\nPrimitives: You\u2019ll select backend-dev chat mode \u2192 Auto-triggers security.instructions.md via applyTo: \\"auth/**\\" \u2192 Loads context from [Previous auth patterns](.memory.md#security) and [API Security Standards](api-security.context.md#rest) \u2192 Generates user-auth.spec.md using structured templates \u2192 Executes implement-from-spec.prompt.md workflow with validation gates.\\nOutcome: Developer-driven knowledge accumulation where you capture implementation failures in .memory.md, document successful patterns in .instructions.md, and refine workflows in .prompt.md files\u2014creating compound intelligence that improves through your iterative refinement.\\nThis transformation might seem complex, but notice the pattern: What started as an ad-hoc request became a systematic workflow with clear handoff points, automatic context loading, and built-in validation.\xa0\\nWhen you use these files and modules, you can keep adjusting and improving how your AI agent works at every step. Every time you iterate, you make your agent a little more reliable and consistent. And this isn\u2019t just random trial and error \u2014 you\u2019re following a structured, repeatable approach that helps you get better and more predictable results every time you use the AI.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Native VS Code support: While VS Code natively supports .instructions.md, .prompt.md, and .chatmode.md files, this framework takes things further with .spec.md, .memory.md, and .context.md patterns that unlock even more exciting possibilities AI-powered software development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith your prompts structured and your agentic primitives set up, you may encounter a new challenge: Even the best prompts and primitives can fail when they\u2019re faced with irrelevant context or they\u2019re competing for limited AI attention. The third layer, which we\u2019ll get to next, addresses this through strategic context management.\\nLayer 3: Context engineering: Helping your AI agents focus on what matters\\nJust like people, LLMs have finite limited memory (context windows), and can sometimes be forgetful. If you can be strategic about the context you give them, you can help them focus on what\u2019s relevant and enable them to get started and work quicker. This helps them preserve valuable context window space and improve their reliability and effectiveness.\\nHere are some techniques to make sure they get the right context\u2014this is called context engineering:\xa0\\nSession splitting: Use distinct agent sessions for different development phases and tasks. For example, use one session for planning, one for implementation, and one for testing. If an agent has fresh context, it\u2019ll have better focus. It\u2019s always better to have a fresh context window for complex tasks.\xa0\\nModular and custom rules and instructions: Apply only relevant instructions through targeted .instructions.md files using applyTo YAML frontmatter syntax. This preserves context space for actual work and reduces irrelevant suggestions.\xa0\\nMemory-driven development: Leverage agent memory through .memory.md files to maintain project knowledge and decisions across sessions and time.\\nContext optimization: Use .context.md context helper files strategically to accelerate information retrieval and reduce cognitive load.\xa0\\nCognitive focus optimization: Use chat modes in .chatmode.md files to keep the AI\u2019s attention on relevant domains and prevent cross-domain interference. Less context pollution means you\u2019ll have more consistent and accurate outputs.\xa0\\nAgentic workflows: The complete system in action\\nNow that you understand all three layers, you can see how they combine into agentic workflows\u2014complete, systematic processes where all of your agentic primitives are working together, understanding your prompts, and using only the context they need.\xa0\xa0\\nThese agentic workflows can be implemented as .prompt.md files that coordinate multiple agentic primitives into processes, designed to work whether executed locally in your IDE, in your terminal or in your CI pipelines.\\nNeed a recap?\xa0\\nMarkdown prompt engineering provides the structural foundation for predictable AI interactions.\\nAgent primitives are your configurable tools that scale and systematize these techniques.\\nContext engineering optimizes AI cognitive performance within memory constraints.\\nAgentic workflows in Markdown apply prompt and context engineering that leverages agent primitives to implement complete, reliable agentic processes.\\nThis framework creates compound intelligence that improves as you continue to iterate.\\nTooling: how to scale agent primitives\\nNow that you understand the three-layer framework and that the agentic primitives are essentially executable software written in natural language, the question is: How can you scale these Markdown files beyond your individual development workflow?\\nNatural language as code\\nThe answer mirrors every programming ecosystem\u2019s evolution. Just like JavaScript evolved from browser scripts to using Node.js runtimes, package managers, and deployment tooling, agent primitives need similar infrastructure to reach their full potential.\\nThis isn\u2019t just a metaphor: These .prompt.md and .instructions.md files represent a genuine new form of software development that requires proper tooling infrastructure.\\nHere\u2019s what we mean: Think of your agent primitives as real pieces of software, just written in natural language instead of code. They have all the same qualities: You can break complex tasks into smaller pieces (modularity), use the same instructions in multiple places (reusability), rely on other tools or files (dependencies), keep improving and updating them (evolution), and share them across teams (distribution).\\nThat said, your natural language programs are going to need the same infrastructure support as any other software.\xa0\xa0\\nAgent CLI runtimes\\nMost developers start by creating and running agent primitives directly in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, which is ideal for interactive development, debugging, and refining daily workflows. However, when you want to move beyond the editor\u2014to automate your workflows, schedule them, or integrate them into larger systems\u2014you need agent CLI runtimes like Copilot CLI.\xa0\\nThese runtimes let you execute your agent primitives from the command line and tap into advanced model capabilities. This shift unlocks automation, scaling, and seamless integration into production environments, taking your natural language programs from personal tools to powerful, shareable solutions.\xa0\\nInner loop vs. outer loop\\nInner loop (VS Code and GitHub Copilot): Interactive development, testing, and workflow refinement\\nOuter loop (agent CLI runtimes): Reproducible execution, CI/CD integration, and production deployment\\nAgent CLI Runtimes transform your agent primitives from IDE-bound files into independently executable workflows that run consistently across any environment. They provide command-line execution, CI/CD integration, environment consistency, and native support for MCP servers, which bridge your development work to production reality.\\nTL;DR: Use the inner loop for rapid, interactive work and the outer loop for reliable, repeatable automation and deployment.\\nRuntime management\\nWhile VS Code and GitHub Copilot handle individual development, some teams may want additional infrastructure for sharing, versioning, and productizing their agent primitives. Managing multiple Agent CLI runtimes can become complex quickly, with different installation procedures, configuration requirements, and compatibility matrices.\\nAPM (Agent Package Manager) solves this by providing unified runtime management and package distribution. Instead of manually installing and configuring each vendor CLI, APM handles the complexity while preserving your existing VS Code workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s how runtime management works in practice:\\n# Install APM once\\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmeppiel/apm/main/install.sh | sh\\n\\n# Optional: setup your GitHub PAT to use GitHub Copilot CLI\\nexport GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT=your_token_here\\n\\n# APM manages runtime installation for you\\napm runtime setup copilot          # Installs GitHub Copilot CLI\\napm runtime setup codex            # Installs OpenAI Codex CLI\\n\\n# Install MCP dependencies (like npm install)\\napm install\\n\\n# Compile Agent Primitive files to Agents.md files\\napm compile\\n\\n# Run workflows against your chosen runtime\\n# This will trigger \'copilot -p security-review.prompt.md\' command \\n# Check the example apm.yml file a bit below in this guide\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\\nAs you can see, your daily development stays exactly the same in VS Code, APM installs and configures runtimes automatically, your workflows run regardless of which runtime is installed, and the same apm run command works consistently across all runtimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDistribution and packaging\\nAgent primitives\u2019 similarities to traditional software become most apparent when you get to the point of wanting to share them with your team or deploying them into production\u2014when you start to require things like package management, dependency resolution, version control, and distribution mechanisms.\\nHere\u2019s the challenge: You\u2019ve built powerful agent primitives in VS Code and your team wants to use them, but distributing Markdown files and ensuring consistent MCP dependencies across different environments becomes unwieldy. You need the equivalent of npm for natural language programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM provides this missing layer. It doesn\u2019t replace your VS Code workflow\u2014it extends it by creating distributable packages of agent primitives complete with dependencies, configuration, and runtime compatibility that teams can share, just like npm packages.\\nPackage management in practice\\n# Initialize new APM project (like npm init)\\napm init security-review-workflow\\n\\n# Develop and test your workflow locally\\ncd security-review-workflow \\napm compile && apm install\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\\n\\n# Package for distribution (future: apm publish)\\n# Share apm.yml and Agent Primitive files with team\\n# Team members can install and use your primitives\\ngit clone your-workflow-repo\\ncd your-workflow-repo && apm compile && apm install\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=456\\nThe benefits compound quickly: You can distribute tested workflows as versioned packages with dependencies, automatically resolve and install required MCP servers, track workflow evolution and maintain compatibility across updates, build on (and contribute to) shared libraries from the community, and ensure everyone\u2019s running the same thing.\\nProject configuration\\nThe following\xa0 apm.yml configuration file serves as the package.json equivalent for agent primitives, defining scripts, dependencies, and input parameters:\\n# apm.yml - Project configuration (like package.json)\\nname: security-review-workflow\\nversion: 1.2.0\\ndescription: Comprehensive security review process with GitHub integration\\n\\nscripts:\\n  copilot-sec-review: \\"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  codex-sec-review: \\"codex security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  copilot-debug: \\"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  \\ndependencies:\\n  mcp:\\n    - ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\\nWith this, your agent primitives can now be packaged as distributable software with managed dependencies.\\nProduction deployment\\nThe final piece of the tooling ecosystem enables continuous AI: packaged agent primitives can now run automatically in the same CI/CD pipelines you use every day, bringing your carefully developed workflows into your production environment.\\nUsing APM GitHub Action, and building on the security-review-workflow package example above, here\u2019s how the same APM project deploys to production with multi-runtime flexibility:\\n# .github/workflows/security-review.yml\\nname: AI Security Review Pipeline\\non: \\n  pull_request:\\n    types: [opened, synchronize]\\n\\njobs:\\n  security-analysis:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    strategy:\\n      matrix:\\n        # Maps to apm.yml scripts\\n        script: [copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug]  \\n    permissions:\\n      models: read\\n      pull-requests: write\\n      contents: read\\n    \\n    steps:\\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\\n    \\n    - name: Run Security Review (${{ matrix.script }})\\n      uses: danielmeppiel/action-apm-cli@v1\\n      with:\\n        script: ${{ matrix.script }}\\n        parameters: |\\n          {\\n            \\"pr_id\\": \\"${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\\"\\n          }\\n      env:\\n        GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT: ${{ secrets.COPILOT_CLI_PAT }}\\nKey connection: The matrix.script values (copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug) correspond exactly to the scripts defined in the apm.yml configuration above. APM automatically installs the MCP dependencies (ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server) and passes the input parameters (pr_id) to your security-review.prompt.md workflow.\\nHere\u2019s why this matters:\xa0\\nAutomation: Your AI workflows now run on their own, without anyone needing to manually trigger them.\\nReliability: They run with the same consistency and reproducibility as traditional code deployments.\\nFlexibility: You can run different versions or types of analysis (mapped to different scripts) as needed.\\nIntegration: These workflows become part of your organization\u2019s standard CI/CD pipelines, just like regular software quality checks.\\nThis setup ultimately means your agent primitives are no longer just local experiments\u2014they are fully automated tools that you can rely on as part of your software delivery process, running in CI/CD whenever needed, with all dependencies and parameters managed for you.\\nEcosystem evolution\\nThis progression follows the same predictable pattern as every successful programming ecosystem. Understanding this pattern helps you see where AI-native development is heading and how to position your work strategically.\\nThe evolution happens in four stages:\\nRaw Code \u2192 agent primitives (.prompt.md, .instructions.md files)\\nRuntime environments \u2192 Agent CLI runtimes\xa0\\nPackage management \u2192 APM (distribution and orchestration layer)\\nThriving ecosystem \u2192 Shared libraries, tools, and community packages\\nJust as npm enabled JavaScript\u2019s explosive growth by solving the package distribution problem, APM enables the agent primitive ecosystem to flourish by providing the missing infrastructure layer that makes sharing and scaling natural language programs practical.\\nThe transformation is profound: what started as individual Markdown files in your editor becomes a systematic software development practice with proper tooling, distribution, and production deployment capabilities.\\nKey takeaways\\nAgent primitives are software: Your .prompt.md and .instructions.md files represent executable natural language programs that deserve professional tooling infrastructure.\\nRuntime diversity enables scale: Agent CLI runtimes provide the execution environments that bridge development to production.\\nPackage management is critical: APM provides the npm-equivalent layer that makes agent primitives truly portable and shareable.\\nProduction ready today: This tooling stack enables automated AI workflows in CI/CD pipelines with enterprise-grade reliability.\\nEcosystem growth pattern: Package management infrastructure creates the foundation for thriving ecosystems of shared workflows, tools, and community libraries.\\nHow to get started with building your first agent primitive\\nNow it\u2019s time to build your first agent primitives. Here\u2019s the plan:\xa0\\nStart with instructions: Write clear instructions that tell the AI exactly what you want it to do and how it should behave.\\nAdd chat modes: Set up special rules (chat modes) to create safe boundaries for the AI, making sure it interacts in the way you want and avoids unwanted behavior.\\nBuild reusable prompts: Create prompt templates for tasks you do often, so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch each time. These templates help the AI handle common jobs quickly and consistently.\\nCreate specification templates: Make templates that help you plan out what you want your AI to accomplish, then turn those plans into actionable steps the AI can follow.\\nInstructions architecture\\nInstructions form the bedrock of reliable AI behavior: They\u2019re the rules that guide the agent without cluttering your immediate context. Rather than repeating the same guidance in every conversation, instructions embed your team\u2019s knowledge directly into the AI\u2019s reasoning process.\\nThe key insight is modularity: instead of one massive instruction file that applies everywhere, you can create targeted files that activate only when working with specific technologies or file types. This context engineering approach keeps your AI focused and your guidance relevant.\\n\u2705 Quick actions:\\nCreate the general copilot-instructions.md file in the .github folder for the repository with common rules.\\nCreate modular .instructions.md files in the .github/instructions/ folder by domain (frontend, backend, testing, docs, specs\u2026).\\nUse applyTo: \\"**/*.{js,ts...}\\" patterns for selective application.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 copilot-instructions.md          # Global repository rules\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 instructions/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend.instructions.md     # applyTo: \\"**/*.{jsx,tsx,css}\\"\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend.instructions.md      # applyTo: \\"**/*.{py,go,java}\\"\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 testing.instructions.md      # applyTo: \\"**/test/**\\"\\nExample: Markdown prompt engineering in Instructions with frontend.instructions.md:\\n---\\napplyTo: \\"**/*.{ts,tsx}\\"\\ndescription: \\"TypeScript development guidelines with context engineering\\"\\n---\\n# TypeScript Development Guidelines\\n\\n\\n## Context Loading\\nReview [project conventions](../docs/conventions.md) and \\n[type definitions](../types/index.ts) before starting.\\n\\n\\n## Deterministic Requirements\\n- Use strict TypeScript configuration\\n- Implement error boundaries for React components\\n- Apply ESLint TypeScript rules consistently\\n\\n\\n## Structured Output\\nGenerate code with:\\n- [ ] JSDoc comments for all public APIs\\n- [ ] Unit tests in `__tests__/` directory\\n- [ ] Type exports in appropriate index files\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Checkpoint: Instructions are context-efficient and non-conflicting.\\nChat modes configuration\\nWith your instruction architecture in place, you still need a way to enforce domain boundaries and prevent AI agents from overstepping their expertise. Chat modes solve this by creating professional boundaries similar to real-world licensing. For example, you\u2019d want your architect to plan a bridge and not build it themself.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s how to set those boundaries:\xa0\\nDefine domain-specific custom chat modes with MCP tool boundaries.\\nEncapsulate tech stack knowledge and guidelines per mode.\\nDefine the most appropriate LLM model for your chat mode.\\nConfigure secure MCP tool access to prevent cross-domain security breaches.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Security through MCP tool boundaries: Each chat mode receives only the specific MCP tools needed for their domain. Giving each chat mode only the tools it needs keeps your AI workflows safe, organized, and professionally separated\u2014just like real-world roles and permissions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 chatmodes/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 architect.chatmode.md             # Planning specialist - designs, cannot execute\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend-engineer.chatmode.md     # UI specialist - builds interfaces, no backend access\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend-engineer.chatmode.md      # API specialist - builds services, no UI modification\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 technical-writer.chatmode.md      # Documentation specialist - writes docs, cannot run code\\nExample: Creating MCP tool boundaries with backend-engineer.chatmode.md:\\n---\\ndescription: \'Backend development specialist with security focus\'\\ntools: [\'changes\', \'codebase\', \'editFiles\', \'runCommands\', \'runTasks\', \\n        \'search\', \'problems\', \'testFailure\', \'terminalLastCommand\']\\nmodel: Claude Sonnet 4\\n---\\nYou are a backend development specialist focused on secure API development, database design, and server-side architecture.

Without a clear, consistent way to document requirements, things can get lost in translation, leading to mistakes, misunderstandings, or missed steps. This is where specification templates come in. These templates ensure that both people and AI agents can take a concept (like a new feature or API) and reliably implement it.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s what these templates help you accomplish:\xa0\\nStandardize the process: You create a new specification for each feature, API endpoint, or component.\\nProvide blueprints for implementation: These specs include everything a developer (or an AI agent) needs to know to start building: the problem, the approach, required components, validation criteria, and a checklist for handoff.\\nMake handoff deterministic: By following a standard, the transition from planning to doing is clear and predictable.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\xa0\\nSpec-kit is a neat tool that fully implements a specification-driven approach to agentic coding. It allows you to easily get started with creating specs (spec.md), an implementation plan (plan.md) and splitting that into actual tasks (tasks.md) ready for developers or coding agents to work on.\\n\u26a0\ufe0f \ufe0fCheckpoint: Specifications are split into tasks that are implementation-ready before delegation.\\nReady to go? Here\u2019s a quickstart checklist\\nYou now have a complete foundation for systematic AI development.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved.

The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair&#8217;s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.</p>\\n<p>The complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation.

Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.</p>\\n<p>In the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing &#8212; and very often bragging about &#8212; serious cybercrime offenses.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Here we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;Most get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they&#8217;re released.</p>\\n<p>Indeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;What we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;The members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Nixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;If law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,&#8221; she said.</p>\\n<p><em>The Times of London</em> <a href=\\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/teenagers-charged-tfl-cyberattack-scattered-spider-trdhs5rwf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">reports</a> that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.\\nAt a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled Transport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.\\n\\nA court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity reported that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider ransom attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group.\\nThat story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group\u2019s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.\\nThe story also noted that Jubair\u2019s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair\u2019s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.\\nEARLY DAYS (2021-2022)\\nJubair is alleged to have been a core member of the LAPSUS$\xa0cybercrime group that\xa0broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including\xa0Microsoft,\xa0Nvidia,\xa0Okta,\xa0Rockstar Games,\xa0Samsung,\xa0T-Mobile, and\xa0Uber.\\nThat is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames Amtrak\xa0and\xa0Asyntax. In the middle of the gang\u2019s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\\nThe leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax\u2019s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:\\n\\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair\u2019s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\\n\\n\\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including \u201cEverlynn,\u201d who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d\xa0targeting the major social media and email providers.\\nIn these so-called \u201cfake EDR\u201d schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\\n\\nThe roster of the now-defunct \u201cInfinity Recursion\u201d hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022.

The member listed as \u201cPeter\u201d became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair\u2019s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$\u2019s chat channel.\\n\\n\\nEARTHTOSTAR\\nProsecutors in New Jersey last week alleged Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, 0ktapus, and UNC3944, and that he used the nicknames EarthtoStar, Brad, Austin, and Austistic.\\nBeginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called Star Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nJubair allegedly used the handle \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.\\n\\nThe group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target\u2019s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim\u2019s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.\\nIn February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with \u201cTmo up!\u201d and \u201cTmo down!\u201d notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile\u2019s network.\\n\\nA redacted receipt from Star Chat\u2019s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.\\n\\nThe data showed that Star Chat \u2014 along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time \u2014 collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.\\n\\nThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.\\n\\nA review of EarthtoStar\u2019s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint shows this person also sold \u201cAT&T email resets\u201d and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:\\n\u201cOk people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says \u20182fa required\u2019 or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?\u201d\\n\\nNew Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022 that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer\u2019s Okta authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.\\nThe phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.\\nThat weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, Plex and Signal.\\n\\nA visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.\\n\\nDA, COMRADE\\nEarthtoStar\u2019s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel \u201cFrauwudchat\u201d:\\n\u201cHi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API\u2019s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.\u201d\\n\\nAt around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat \u2014 \u201cRocketAce\u201d and \u201cLopiu\u201d \u2014 introduced the group\u2019s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit, including:\\n-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;\\n\\nThe user \u201cLopiu\u201d on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.\\n\\nThese two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar\u2019s many aliases, posted to Exploit:\\nHello. I have access to a telecommunications company\u2019s citrix and vpn. I would like someone to help me break out of the system and potentially attack the domain controller so all logins can be extracted we can discuss payment and things leave your telegram in the comments or private message me ! Looking for someone with knowledge in citrix/privilege escalation\\n\\nOn Nov. 15, 2022, EarthtoStar posted to their Star Sanctuary Telegram channel that they were hiring malware developers with a minimum of three years of experience and the ability to develop rootkits, backdoors and malware loaders.\\n\u201cOptional: Endorsed by advanced APT Groups (e.g. Conti, Ryuk),\u201d the ad concluded, referencing two of Russia\u2019s most rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate operations. \u201cPart of a nation-state / ex-3l (3 letter-agency).\u201d\\n2023-PRESENT DAY\\nThe Telegram and Discord chat channels wherein Flowers and Jubair allegedly planned and executed their extortion attacks are part of a loose-knit network known as the Com, an English-speaking cybercrime community consisting mostly of individuals living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\\nMany of these Com chat servers have hundreds to thousands of members each, and some of the more interesting solicitations on these communities are job offers for in-person assignments and tasks that can be found if one searches for posts titled, \u201cIf you live near,\u201d or \u201cIRL job\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cin real life\u201d job.\\nThese \u201cviolence-as-a-service\u201d solicitations typically involve \u201cbrickings,\u201d where someone is hired to toss a brick through the window at a specified address. Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it\u2019s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.\\nIt remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department\u2019s website, along with the message:\\n\u201cNeed irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either\u201d\\n\\nThroughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar\u2019s alias \u201cBrad\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cBrad_banned\u201d) frequently advertised Star Chat\u2019s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker\u2019s presence on a victim machine:\\nWe can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,\\nThis shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!\\nKernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.\\nBypass all major EDR\u2019s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)\\nOnce implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)\\nBe one step ahead of the game. Prices start from $5,000+. Message @brad_banned to get a quote\\n\\nIn September 2023 , both MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment suffered ransomware attacks at the hands of a Russian ransomware affiliate program known as ALPHV and BlackCat. Caesars reportedly paid a $15 million ransom in that incident.\\nWithin hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they\u2019d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.\\nThe Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.\\nIn April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of \u201cThe Com Cast,\u201d a lengthy screed detailing Jubair\u2019s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years. This account included photos and voice recordings allegedly of Jubair, and asserted that in his early days on the Com Jubair used the nicknames Clark and Miku (these are both aliases used by Everlynn in connection with their fake EDR services).\\n\\nThalha Jubair (right), without his large-rimmed glasses, in an undated photo posted in The Com Cast.\\n\\nMore recently, the anonymous Com Cast author(s) claimed, Jubair had used the nickname \u201cOperator,\u201d which corresponds to a Com member who ran an automated Telegram-based doxing service that pulled consumer records from hacked data broker accounts. That public outing came after Operator allegedly seized control over the Doxbin, a long-running and highly toxic community that is used to \u201cdox\u201d or post deeply personal information on people.\\n\u201cOperator/Clark/Miku: A key member of the ransomware group Scattered Spider, which consists of a diverse mix of individuals involved in SIM swapping and phishing,\u201d the Com Cast account stated. \u201cThe group is an amalgamation of several key organizations, including Infinity Recursion (owned by Operator), True Alcorians (owned by earth2star), and Lapsus, which have come together to form a single collective.\u201d\\nThe New Jersey complaint (PDF) alleges Jubair and other Scattered Spider members committed computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in relation to at least 120 computer network intrusions involving 47 U.S. entities between May 2022 and September 2025. The complaint alleges the group\u2019s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.\\nU.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair\u2019s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.\\nThe complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida man charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.\\nUrban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.\\n\\nNoah \u201cKingbob\u201d Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.\\n\\nA\xa0court transcript (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban\u2019s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.\\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B, and easily one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.\\nIn the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing \u2014 and very often bragging about \u2014 serious cybercrime offenses.\\n\u201cHere we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cMost get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d\\nNixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they\u2019re released.\\nIndeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.\\n\u201cWhat we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.\u201d\\nNixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.\\n\u201cIf law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,\u201d she said.\\nThe Times of London reports that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.\\nJubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.\\nIn the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. If extradited to the U.S., tried and convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison.\\nIn July 2025, the United Kingdom barred victims of hacking from paying ransoms to cybercriminal groups unless approved by officials. U.K. organizations that are considered part of critical infrastructure reportedly will face a complete ban, as will the entire public sector. U.K. victims of a hack are now required to notify officials to better inform policymakers on the scale of Britain\u2019s ransomware problem.\\nFor further reading (bless you), check out Bloomberg\u2019s poignant story last week based on a year\u2019s worth of jailhouse interviews with convicted Scattered Spider member Noah Urban.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/feds-tie-scattered-spider-duo-to-115m-in-ransoms/#comments","description":"U.S. prosecutors last week levied criminal hacking charges against 19-year-old U.K. national Thalha Jubair for allegedly being a core member of Scattered Spider, a prolific cybercrime group blamed for extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from victims.

After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30.

The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage. NASA FIRMS continued to detect active fires in Etosha up until Oct. 5. \\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015.

Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features.

In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/globalsumudflotilla/p/DOXEm8viAZO/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">official statement</a> said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/DGGN1956/posts/812698534423606?ref=embed_post\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">National Guard on Facebook</a> stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZqrkLCnSl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">video</a> showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat.

No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXaR_MiOZ_/?igsh=YjdnaTEybGNocW94\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">recorded</a> from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast &#8211; the highest point on the vessel &#8211; before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"551\\" height=\\"987\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Gaza-flotilla-higher-colour-reduction-gif.gif\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49793\\"/></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Screencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat.

He can be seen <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXL9KhjJaK/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">in a video</a> from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXMeRaiq9t/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">said</a> in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Duarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXSL3jClWD/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">available</a> open sources documenting this strike.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"915\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49774\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg 1080w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-300x254.jpg 300w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-768x651.jpg 768w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Burned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions.

It turns out that just 13 percent globally are actually prepared for the AI revolution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, this small group \u2013 which Cisco calls the &#8216;Pacesetters&#8217; \u2013 are lapping the competition. The third annual Cisco AI Readiness Index found these top performers are four times more likely to get their AI projects out of the pilot stage and into the real world. More importantly, they are 50 percent more likely to see measurable value from their efforts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What they&#8217;ve figured out is that winning with AI is about getting the foundations right with a disciplined approach that weaves together strategy, infrastructure, and security. And it pays off, with 90 percent of these Pacesetters seeing real gains in profit, productivity, and innovation, while most of their peers are hovering around the 60 percent mark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s President and Chief Product Officer, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s Cisco AI Readiness Index makes one thing clear: AI doesn\u2019t fail, readiness fails.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201cThe most AI-ready organisations \u2013 the Pacesetters from our research \u2013 prove it. They\u2019re four times more likely to move pilots into production and 50 percent more likely to realise measurable value. So, with more than 80 percent of organisations we surveyed about to deploy AI agents, these new findings confirm readiness, discipline, and action are key to unlocking value.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, what\u2019s their secret? The research shows a clear pattern. Pacesetters don\u2019t treat AI as a side project; it&#8217;s a core part of their business strategy. Almost every single one of them (99%) has a proper AI roadmap, something only 58 percent of other companies can claim. They also put their money where their mouth is. For 79 percent of them, AI is the top investment priority, a commitment shared by only 24 percent of the rest.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These leaders are building for the long haul, with 98 percent designing their networks to handle the immense scale and complexity of AI, compared to just 46 percent of their peers. It gives them the confidence that their systems can handle whatever is thrown at them; 71 percent say their networks can scale instantly for any AI project, a feeling shared by a worryingly low 15 percent of other organisations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The report also gives us a glimpse into the near future, and for many, it looks rocky. Two huge challenges are looming: the widespread use of AI agents and a problem Cisco has dubbed &#8216;AI Infrastructure Debt&#8217;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>83 percent of companies are planning to deploy AI agents as part of their strategy, with nearly 40 percent expecting them to be working alongside human employees within a year. But here\u2019s the problem: most of these firms are trying to build on shaky ground.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over half of companies admitted their current networks simply can&#8217;t handle the data volumes or complexity that these advanced AI systems demand. The Pacesetters, on the other hand, have already done their homework, with 75 percent feeling fully equipped to secure and control these agents, compared to just 31 percent of others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This leads us to the ticking time bomb of \u2018AI Infrastructure Debt\u2019. Think of it as the modern version of the technical debt that plagued companies for years. It\u2019s the result of all the compromises, postponed upgrades, and underfunded plans that quietly pile up, slowly strangling the long-term value of AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The warning signs are already flashing. Nearly two-thirds of leaders expect their workloads to jump by over 30 percent in the next three years, and a similar number are struggling just to get their data organised in one place. Add to that the fact that only a quarter have enough GPU power, and you see a massive gap between ambition and reality.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The lesson from Cisco\u2019s report is clear and simple: value follows readiness.

It turns out that just 13 percent globally are actually prepared for the AI revolution.\\nHowever, this small group \u2013 which Cisco calls the \u2018Pacesetters\u2019 \u2013 are lapping the competition. The third annual Cisco AI Readiness Index found these top performers are four times more likely to get their AI projects out of the pilot stage and into the real world. More importantly, they are 50 percent more likely to see measurable value from their efforts.\\nWhat they\u2019ve figured out is that winning with AI is about getting the foundations right with a disciplined approach that weaves together strategy, infrastructure, and security. And it pays off, with 90 percent of these Pacesetters seeing real gains in profit, productivity, and innovation, while most of their peers are hovering around the 60 percent mark.\\nJeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s President and Chief Product Officer, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s Cisco AI Readiness Index makes one thing clear: AI doesn\u2019t fail, readiness fails.\\n\u201cThe most AI-ready organisations \u2013 the Pacesetters from our research \u2013 prove it. They\u2019re four times more likely to move pilots into production and 50 percent more likely to realise measurable value. So, with more than 80 percent of organisations we surveyed about to deploy AI agents, these new findings confirm readiness, discipline, and action are key to unlocking value.\u201d\xa0\\nSo, what\u2019s their secret? The research shows a clear pattern. Pacesetters don\u2019t treat AI as a side project; it\u2019s a core part of their business strategy. Almost every single one of them (99%) has a proper AI roadmap, something only 58 percent of other companies can claim. They also put their money where their mouth is. For 79 percent of them, AI is the top investment priority, a commitment shared by only 24 percent of the rest.\\nThese leaders are building for the long haul, with 98 percent designing their networks to handle the immense scale and complexity of AI, compared to just 46 percent of their peers. It gives them the confidence that their systems can handle whatever is thrown at them; 71 percent say their networks can scale instantly for any AI project, a feeling shared by a worryingly low 15 percent of other organisations.\\nThe report also gives us a glimpse into the near future, and for many, it looks rocky. Two huge challenges are looming: the widespread use of AI agents and a problem Cisco has dubbed \u2018AI Infrastructure Debt\u2019.\\n83 percent of companies are planning to deploy AI agents as part of their strategy, with nearly 40 percent expecting them to be working alongside human employees within a year. But here\u2019s the problem: most of these firms are trying to build on shaky ground.\\nOver half of companies admitted their current networks simply can\u2019t handle the data volumes or complexity that these advanced AI systems demand. The Pacesetters, on the other hand, have already done their homework, with 75 percent feeling fully equipped to secure and control these agents, compared to just 31 percent of others.\\nThis leads us to the ticking time bomb of \u2018AI Infrastructure Debt\u2019. Think of it as the modern version of the technical debt that plagued companies for years. It\u2019s the result of all the compromises, postponed upgrades, and underfunded plans that quietly pile up, slowly strangling the long-term value of AI.\\nThe warning signs are already flashing. Nearly two-thirds of leaders expect their workloads to jump by over 30 percent in the next three years, and a similar number are struggling just to get their data organised in one place. Add to that the fact that only a quarter have enough GPU power, and you see a massive gap between ambition and reality.\\nThe lesson from Cisco\u2019s report is clear and simple: value follows readiness. In the race to adopt AI, the Pacesetters have shown that the organisations that take the time to build a strong foundation to support their strategy are the ones that will pull away from the pack.\\nSee also: Gemini Enterprise: Google aims to put an AI agent on every desk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

editor with that little gray box. It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on <em>real</em> repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.</p>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"from-idea-to-merge-in-record-time-%e2%9a%a1\\">From idea to merge in record time &#9889;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext-edit suggestions: Copilot predicts the next change you\u2019ll make and offers it inline. One Tab and you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow-latency completions: Most Copilot responses now render in under 400 ms (fast enough that you stop noticing them).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopilot CLI: The same brains, now in your terminal. Setup, debug, and script without switching windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMulti-model routing: Different jobs call for different brains. Copilot gives you access to multiple LLMs from leading frontier AI firms.\xa0\\nThe result: fewer interruptions, faster loops, and a workflow that finally keeps pace with how you think.\\nAI that scales with your workflow \ud83d\udcd0\\nCopilot doesn\u2019t live in a new environment you need to learn. It\u2019s part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\xa0\\nJetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity: Same Copilot, wherever you build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom instructions: Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGitHub MCP Server: Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkspace prompt files: Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20M+ developers strong: Every Copilot update compounds through the world\u2019s largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\\nCopilot isn\u2019t a separate tool you \u201cadd\u201d to GitHub. It\u2019s part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\\nSmarter, cleaner, and safer code \ud83d\udd0d\\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know). We\u2019ve spent a lot of cycles quietly leveling up Copilot\u2019s overall code quality and security guardrails where they matter most to you.\xa0\\nCopilot Autofix: Detects and patches vulnerabilities automatically (it was used to fix over a million vulnerabilities this year alone).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCode review: Summarizes diffs, flags logic bugs, and suggests fixes right inside your pull requests with a tool that powers millions of code reviews a month on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImproved model reasoning: Generates more readable, test-passing code with fewer lint errors and less regressions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL integration: Integrations with GitHub Advanced Security, Dependabot, and GitHub Actions keeps your supply chain solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilt-in privacy: Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant-level control mean your work stays off the grid.\xa0\\nOur research shows new code written with Copilot tends to have higher readability, better reliability, and improved maintainability scores.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s the good news: Copilot\u2019s backed by the same security stack that protects the world\u2019s largest open source ecosystem and more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal talk: Copilot vs. the rest \ud83d\udc40\\nLet\u2019s be honest: there are some great tools out there that make agentic coding workflows feel intuitive and bring real polish to multi-file editing.\xa0\\nCopilot lives in GitHub. That means it\u2019s close to everything else you do, whether it\u2019s your pull requests, GitHub Actions workflows, or CI/CD pipelines. Every day, GitHub powers over 3 million pull request merges and 50 million actions runs. And Copilot lives in that flow.\xa0\\nOther tools might help you write code faster. But Copilot helps you ship better software.\\nThat means:\xa0\\nNo migration, no new IDE, no new habits: Copilot lives inside the tools you already use.\xa0\\nFull-stack awareness: Your pull requests, reviews, tests, and workflows are part of the same conversation.\xa0\\nEnd-to-end coverage: Copilot brings AI assistance to real-world delivery.\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next \ud83d\ude80\\nWe\u2019re just getting started.\\nAt the end of this month, GitHub Universe 2025 kicks off, and you can expect a lot of news. From smarter agent workflows to deeper multi-model integration and next-gen security features, we\u2019re building what\u2019s next for how software gets built.\\nBecause our goal hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re here to help every developer commit code faster instead of chasing TODOs.\xa0\\nReady to see how far we\u2019ve come?

Here&rsquo;s what that looks like:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Translation:</strong> If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Structural analysis: </strong>COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you&rsquo;ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they&rsquo;re predictable. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>COBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>ENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>DATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>PROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ask GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you.

You don&rsquo;t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL&rsquo;s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Documentation as source of truth:</strong> Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference.

This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Julia&rsquo;s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what this orchestration looks like in practice:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Call chain mapping:</strong> Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact.

The tests become your safety net during migration.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Dependency optimization:</strong> Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you&rsquo;re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Think of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line.

We\u2019re talking about COBOL, a programming language that\u2019s been around for 65 years. That\u2019s older than the internet.\\nNow, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014COBOL isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, it\u2019s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.\\nThe problem? Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns. The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.\\nBut here\u2019s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.\\nMeet the developer who\u2019s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)\\nI recently spoke with Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who\u2019s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What\u2019s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.\\nJulia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn\u2019t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions. The COBOL experts provided the legacy system knowledge.\\nWhen this whole idea of Gen AI appeared, we were thinking about how we can actually use AI to solve this problem that has not been really solved yet.\\nJulia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt\\nThe three-step framework for AI-powered legacy modernization\\nJulia and her team at Microsoft have cracked the code (pun intended) with a systematic approach that works for any legacy modernization project, not just COBOL. Here\u2019s their GitHub Copilot powered, battle-tested framework.\\nStep 1: Code preparation (reverse engineering)\\nThe biggest problem with legacy systems? Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool. Instead of hiring consultants to spend months analyzing code, you can use AI to:\\nExtract business logic from legacy files.\\nDocument everything in markdown for human review.\\nAutomatically identify call chains and dependencies.\\nClean up irrelevant comments and historical logs.\\nAdd additional information as comments where needed.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Always have human experts review AI-generated analysis. AI is incredible at pattern recognition, but domain knowledge still matters for business context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s what GitHub Copilot generates for you:\xa0\\n# Business Logic Analysis Generated by GitHub Copilot\\n## File Inventory\\n- listings.cobol: List management functionality (~100 lines)\\n- mainframe-example.cobol: Full mainframe program (~10K lines, high complexity)\\n\\n## Business Purpose\\nCustomer account validation with balance checking\\n- Validates account numbers against master file\\n- Performs balance calculations with overdraft protection\\n- Generates transaction logs for audit compliance\\n\\n## Dependencies Discovered\\n- DB2 database connections via SQLCA\\n- External validation service calls\\n- Legacy print queue system\\nStep 2: Enrichment (making code AI-digestible)\\nYou usually need to add context to help AI understand your code better. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\\nTranslation: If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.\\nStructural analysis: COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you\u2019ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they\u2019re predictable. Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL\u2019s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.\\nDocumentation as source of truth: Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: \u201cEverything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.\u201d\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: COBOL\u2019s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid chart example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality check: It\u2019s not a silver bullet\\nJulia\u2019s brutally honest about limitations:\\nEveryone who\u2019s currently promising you, \u2018hey, I can solve all your mainframe problems with just one click\u2019 is lying to you.\\nThe reality is:\\nHumans must stay in the loop for validation.\\nEach COBOL codebase is unique and complex.\\nWe\u2019re early in the agentic AI journey.\\nFull automation is probably at least five years away.\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make massive progress today.\\nSee it in action: the Azure samples framework\\nJulia and her team have open-sourced their entire framework. It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt. It\u2019s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.\\nThe traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that\u2019s unmaintainable. I\u2019ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don\u2019t understand in a language they\u2019re still learning.\\nThe AI-powered approach changes this. You use AI to understand business logic, generate human-readable modern code, and maintain control of your intellectual property. Your team stays involved throughout the process. They learn the business logic as they go. The code that comes out the other end is something your developers can actually work with.\\nJulia explained the shift:\\nWhat a lot of customers do not want to actually give all their intellectual property like a hundred percent to a partner anymore, right? They want to keep it in check.\\nStart here: your path to becoming the modernization hero\\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with COBOL, ancient Java, or any legacy system, here\u2019s how you can start today:\\nStart small\\nIdentify one problematic legacy system (start with fewer than 5,000 lines)\\nUse GitHub Copilot to analyze a single file\\nDocument what you discover in markdown\\nShare findings with your team\\nBuild your AI toolkit\\nExperiment with the Azure Samples framework\\nLearn prompt engineering for code analysis (try: \u201cAnalyze this COBOL program and explain its business purpose in simple terms\u201d)\\nPractice iterative modernization techniques\\nThink beyond code\\nConsider nonfunctional requirements for cloud-native design\\nPlan for distributed systems architecture\\nRemember: most COBOL programs are doing simple CRUD operations. They don\u2019t need the complexity of a mainframe. They need the simplicity of modern architecture.\\nHere\u2019s a challenge: Find a legacy system in your organization. Six-month-old code counts as legacy in our industry. Try using GitHub Copilot to:\\nGenerate business logic documentation\\nIdentify potential modernization opportunities\\nCreate a migration plan with human validation checkpoints\\nShare your results on LinkedIn and tag me. I\u2019d love to see what you discover.\\nThe best time to start is now\\nThe most powerful insight from my conversation with Julia is this: AI doesn\u2019t replace developer expertise. It amplifies it.\\nCOBOL experts bring irreplaceable domain knowledge. Modern developers bring fresh perspectives on architecture and best practices. AI brings pattern recognition and translation capabilities at scale.\\nWhen these three forces work together, legacy modernization transforms from an impossible challenge into an achievable project.\\nThe best time to modernize legacy code was 10 years ago.

Normally, you&rsquo;d spend time reading through the README, manually checking dependencies, and combing through open issues to find a place to start. But with Copilot CLI, you can offload all of that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"1-clone-and-launch-copilot\\">1.

Get oriented in a new codebase</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you&rsquo;re inside the project, the first step is understanding how everything fits together. Instead of scrolling through files manually or piecing it together from the README, ask Copilot to explain it for you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-video\\"><video controls poster=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-at-2.36.18-PM.png\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/explain.mp4\\"></video></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Explain the layout of this project.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot inspects the repository using find, tree, and the README, then returns a clean Markdown summary. No more hunting through nested directories trying to figure out where things live.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-3-check-your-environment\\">3. Check your environment</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After you know the lay of the land, the next question is: can you actually build it? Normally, you&rsquo;d spend time hunting for dependencies and making sure you&rsquo;ve installed the right versions. Copilot now handles that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Make sure my environment is ready to build this project.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot verifies dependencies, installs missing tools (like Go for the GitHub CLI), and confirms you can build locally. All without you having to comb through setup docs or run trial-and-error commands.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"4-find-a-good-first-issue\\">4. Find a good first issue</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;re set up, you&rsquo;ll want to start contributing.

Instead of scanning dozens of issues, you can dive straight into a task that matches your comfort zone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"5-start-implementing\\">5. Start implementing</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now comes the real work. Normally, after finding an issue to work on, you&rsquo;d create a branch, open the right files, make edits, and double-check your changes before committing. With Copilot CLI, you can let it draft the fix for you while you stay in control at every step.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Start implementing issue #1234. Show me the diff before applying.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot drafts a plan, makes the edits, and presents the diff. You stay in control, review, and approve before changes are applied.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128064; Pro tip</strong>: You can <code>@-mention</code> files in your prompt if you want Copilot to focus on specific parts of the code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"6-commit-and-open-a-draft-pull-request\\">6. Commit and open a draft pull request&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once the changes look good, the next step is packaging them up and sharing your work. Normally, that means staging files, writing a commit message, pushing a branch, and opening a pull request, which is all a bit of a dance in Git. Copilot CLI streamlines the whole flow so you can stay focused on the code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Stage changes, write a commit referencing #1234, and open a draft PR.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot will then stage files, write the commit message, and open a draft pull request for you to review.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"7-bonus-kill-that-process-hogging-your-port\\">7. Bonus: Kill that process hogging your port</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve hit another common headache: a process hogging a port. You know, that moment when you try to start your dev server and it tells you a port (let&rsquo;s say 8080 for this example) is already in use, and you have to go hunting for the right lsof command and flags.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>What process is using port 8080? Kill it and verify the port is free.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot runs the right lsof command, shows the PID, kills the process, and verifies it&rsquo;s gone. No more Googling arcane flags or trying to remember if it&rsquo;s lsof -i :8080 or lsof -t -i:8080 or something else entirely.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;m horrible at remembering commands, especially ones I use infrequently. With Copilot CLI, I just defer these tasks straight to it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll remember the command next time, or maybe (probably) not.

You clone repositories there, install dependencies, debug issues, and run builds. But until now, when you needed AI help, you had to leave the CLI and open your editor or browser. Not anymore.\\nGitHub Copilot CLI brings that same assistance straight to your shell. No switching contexts, no breaking flow. Just you, your terminal, and an AI that can actually help you get things done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall once, authenticate, and start working\\nWith Copilot CLI, you don\u2019t have to juggle your API keys. Just install the assistant, sign in with your existing GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plan, and go. \xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# 1. Install via npm\\nnpm install -g @github/copilot\\n\\n# 2. Launch Copilot CLI\\ncopilot\\n\\n# Authenticate with your GitHub account\\n/login\\nRequirements:\\nNode v22+\\nnpm version 10 or later\\nLaunch Copilot CLI\\nLog in with your GitHub account\xa0\\nFrom here, you can get hands-on immediately\u2014debugging tests, spinning up preview deploys, or writing one-off scripts\u2014without leaving your terminal.\xa0\\nUse case: From clone to pull request in the terminal\\nImagine this: You\u2019ve just cloned a repository you want to contribute to. Normally, you\u2019d spend time reading through the README, manually checking dependencies, and combing through open issues to find a place to start. But with Copilot CLI, you can offload all of that.\\n1. Clone and launch Copilot\\nFirst things first. Grab the repository you want to work on and run Copilot CLI in your terminal.\xa0\\ngh repo clone github/spec-kit\\ncd spec-kit\\ncopilot\\nCopilot greets you in the terminal. Type / at any time to see available commands, or use Ctrl+R to see logs of the commands Copilot has run on your behalf.\\n2. Get oriented in a new codebase\\nOnce you\u2019re inside the project, the first step is understanding how everything fits together. Instead of scrolling through files manually or piecing it together from the README, ask Copilot to explain it for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou say: Explain the layout of this project.\\nCopilot inspects the repository using find, tree, and the README, then returns a clean Markdown summary. No more hunting through nested directories trying to figure out where things live.\\n3. Check your environment\\nAfter you know the lay of the land, the next question is: can you actually build it? Normally, you\u2019d spend time hunting for dependencies and making sure you\u2019ve installed the right versions. Copilot now handles that.\\nYou say: Make sure my environment is ready to build this project.\\nCopilot verifies dependencies, installs missing tools (like Go for the GitHub CLI), and confirms you can build locally. All without you having to comb through setup docs or run trial-and-error commands.\\n4. Find a good first issue\\nNow that you\u2019re set up, you\u2019ll want to start contributing. Instead of browsing through dozens of open issues, let Copilot surface the ones that make sense for you.\\nYou say: Find good first issues in this repository and rank them by difficulty.\\nCopilot queries GitHub Issues with its built-in GitHub MCP server and suggests a curated list, complete with difficulty levels. Instead of scanning dozens of issues, you can dive straight into a task that matches your comfort zone.\\n5. Start implementing\\nNow comes the real work. Normally, after finding an issue to work on, you\u2019d create a branch, open the right files, make edits, and double-check your changes before committing. With Copilot CLI, you can let it draft the fix for you while you stay in control at every step.\\nYou say: Start implementing issue #1234. Show me the diff before applying.\\nCopilot drafts a plan, makes the edits, and presents the diff. You stay in control, review, and approve before changes are applied.\xa0\\n\ud83d\udc40 Pro tip: You can @-mention files in your prompt if you want Copilot to focus on specific parts of the code.\\n6. Commit and open a draft pull request\xa0\\nOnce the changes look good, the next step is packaging them up and sharing your work. Normally, that means staging files, writing a commit message, pushing a branch, and opening a pull request, which is all a bit of a dance in Git. Copilot CLI streamlines the whole flow so you can stay focused on the code.\\nYou say: Stage changes, write a commit referencing #1234, and open a draft PR.\\nCopilot will then stage files, write the commit message, and open a draft pull request for you to review.\xa0\\n7. Bonus: Kill that process hogging your port\\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve hit another common headache: a process hogging a port. You know, that moment when you try to start your dev server and it tells you a port (let\u2019s say 8080 for this example) is already in use, and you have to go hunting for the right lsof command and flags.\\nYou say: What process is using port 8080? Kill it and verify the port is free.\\nCopilot runs the right lsof command, shows the PID, kills the process, and verifies it\u2019s gone. No more Googling arcane flags or trying to remember if it\u2019s lsof -i :8080 or lsof -t -i:8080 or something else entirely.\\nI\u2019m horrible at remembering commands, especially ones I use infrequently. With Copilot CLI, I just defer these tasks straight to it. Maybe I\u2019ll remember the command next time, or maybe (probably) not. But I\u2019ll definitely ask Copilot again.\\nStay in control\\nCopilot always asks before running commands or accessing directories. This is critical when you\u2019re giving an AI access to run things on your machine.\\nBefore Copilot can execute anything, it will prompt you to:\\nAllow once\\nAllow always for this command\\nDeny\\nYou can also:\\nUse /session to view what\u2019s currently allowed\\nReset permissions at any time with /reset\\nAdd directories to your allowed list with /add-directory\\nExtend with MCP servers\\nCopilot CLI ships with the GitHub MCP server already installed and running. This is what powers the issue search and repository interactions. But you can add any MCP server you want from the registry using /mcp.\\nWant to add Playwright for browser testing? Or integrate with your company\u2019s internal tools? You can customize and extend Copilot CLI to match your workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy this matters\\nHere\u2019s what I appreciate most about Copilot CLI: It meets me where I already work. I spend a lot of time in the terminal anyway, jumping between repositories, checking logs, running builds. Having Copilot right there means I\u2019m not constantly switching contexts between my IDE, browser, and command line just to get AI help.\\nWhen I\u2019m onboarding contributors to our projects or exploring a new codebase myself, I can stay in that flow. I can ask about the project structure, verify dependencies, find issues to work on, and start implementing without bouncing around between tools. That consistency matters when you\u2019re trying to maintain momentum.\\nThis isn\u2019t about replacing your IDE. It\u2019s about having the right tool in the right place.\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next\\nCopilot CLI is in public preview, and your feedback will shape our roadmap. We have ideas for what\u2019s coming next, but we want to know what matters most to you.\\n\ud83d\udc49 Install it today with:\\nnpm install -g copilot\\nThen share your experience using /feedback.\\nStart using GitHub Copilot CLI >\\n\\nThe post GitHub Copilot CLI: How to get started appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"Andrea Griffiths","description":"<p>Discover how to use GitHub Copilot directly in the terminal.

But here&rsquo;s what you need to know: The clearer, more precise, more context-rich your prompt, the better, more accurate your outcome. This is where Markdown comes in. With Markdown&rsquo;s structure (its headers, lists, and links), you can naturally guide AI&rsquo;s reasoning, making outputs more predictable and consistent.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To provide a strong foundation for your prompt engineering, try these techniques with Markdown as your guide:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Context loading</strong>: <code>[Review existing patterns](./src/patterns/)</code>.

For example, use one session for planning, one for implementation, and one for testing. If an agent has fresh context, it&rsquo;ll have better focus. It&rsquo;s always better to have a fresh context window for complex tasks.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Modular and custom rules and instructions</strong>: Apply only relevant instructions through targeted <code>.instructions.md</code> files using <code>applyTo</code> YAML frontmatter syntax. This preserves context space for actual work and reduces irrelevant suggestions.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Memory-driven development</strong>: Leverage agent memory through <code>.memory.md</code> files to maintain project knowledge and decisions across sessions and time.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Context optimization</strong>: Use <code>.context.md</code> context helper files strategically to accelerate information retrieval and reduce cognitive load.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Cognitive focus optimization</strong>: Use chat modes in <code>.chatmode.md</code> files to keep the AI&rsquo;s attention on relevant domains and prevent cross-domain interference.

Perhaps you started the same way: You opened GitHub Copilot, started asking questions in natural language, and hoped for a usable output. This approach can work for simple fixes and code suggestions, but as your needs get more complex\u2014or as your work gets more collaborative\u2014you\u2019re going to need a more foolproof strategy.\xa0\\nThis guide will introduce you to a three-part framework that transforms this ad-hoc style of AI experimentation into a repeatable and reliable engineering practice. At its core are two concepts: agentic primitives, which are reusable, configurable building blocks that enable AI agents to work systematically; and context engineering, which ensures your AI agents always focus on the right information. By familiarizing yourself with these concepts, you\u2019ll be able to build AI systems that can not only code independently, but do so reliably, predictably, and consistently.\\nThe AI-native development framework\\nMarkdown prompt engineering + agent primitives + context engineering = reliability\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re new to AI-native development or looking to bring deeper reliability to your agent workflows, this guide will give you the foundation you need to build, scale, and share intelligent systems that learn and improve with every use.\\n\ud83e\udde0 Try it yourself: Build and run agentic workflows with GitHub Copilot CLI\\nBring your agent primitives to life right from your terminal. The new GitHub Copilot CLI lets you run, debug, and automate AI workflows locally\u2014no setup scripts, no context loss. It connects directly to your repositories, pull requests, and issues through GitHub MCP, giving your agents the same context they\u2019d have in your IDE.\xa0\\n\ud83d\udc49 Get started with GitHub Copilot CLI >\\nWhat are agent primitives?\xa0\\nThe three-layer framework below turns ad-hoc AI experimentation into a reliable, repeatable process. It does this by combining the structure of Markdown; the power of agent primitives, simple building blocks that give your AI agents clear instructions and capabilities; and smart context management, so your agents always get the right information (not just more information).\xa0\\nLayer 1: Use Markdown for more strategic prompt engineering\\nWe\u2019ve written about the importance of prompt engineering. But here\u2019s what you need to know: The clearer, more precise, more context-rich your prompt, the better, more accurate your outcome. This is where Markdown comes in. With Markdown\u2019s structure (its headers, lists, and links), you can naturally guide AI\u2019s reasoning, making outputs more predictable and consistent.\xa0\\nTo provide a strong foundation for your prompt engineering, try these techniques with Markdown as your guide:\xa0\\nContext loading: [Review existing patterns](./src/patterns/). In this case, links become context injection points that pull in relevant information, either from files or websites.\\nStructured thinking: Use headers and bullets to create clear reasoning pathways for the AI to follow.\\nRole activation: Use phrases like \u201cYou are an expert [in this role].\u201d This triggers specialized knowledge domains and will focus the AI\u2019s responses.\\nTool integration: Use MCP tool tool-name. This lets your AI agent run code in a controlled, repeatable, and predictable way on MCP servers.\\nPrecise language: Eliminate ambiguity through specific instructions.\\nValidation gates: \u201cStop and get user approval.\u201d Make sure there is always human oversight at critical decision points.\\nFor example, instead of saying, Find and fix the bug, use the following:\\nYou are an expert debugger, specialized in debugging complex programming issues.\\n\\nYou are particularly great at debugging this project, which architecture and quirks can be consulted in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture.md). \\n\\nFollow these steps:\\n\\n1. Review the [error logs](./logs/error.log) and identify the root cause. \\n\\n2. Use the `azmcp-monitor-log-query` MCP tool to retrieve infrastructure logs from Azure.  \\n\\n3. Once you find the root cause, think about 3 potential solutions with trade-offs\\n\\n4. Present your root cause analysis and suggested solutions with trade-offs to the user and seek validation before proceeding with fixes - do not change any files.\\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable with structured prompting, you\u2019ll quickly realize that manually crafting perfect prompts for every task is unsustainable. (Who has the time?) This is where the second step comes in: turning your prompt engineering insights into reusable, configurable systems.\\nLayer 2: Agentic primitives: Deploying your new prompt engineering techniques\\nNow it\u2019s time to implement all of your new strategies more systematically, instead of prompting ad hoc. These configurable tools will help you do just that.\\nCore agent primitives\\nWhen it comes to AI-native development, a core agent primitive refers to a simple, reusable file or module that provides a specific capability or rule for an agent.\xa0\\nHere are some examples:\\nInstructions files: Deploy structured guidance through modular .instructions.md files with targeted scope. At GitHub, we offer custom instructions to give Copilot repository-specific guidance and preferences.\xa0\\nChat modes: Deploy role-based expertise through .chatmode.md files with MCP tool boundaries that prevent security breaches and cross-domain interference. For example, professional licenses that keep architects from building and engineers from planning.\\nAgentic workflows: Deploy reusable prompts through .prompt.md files with built-in validation.\\nSpecification files: Create implementation-ready blueprints through .spec.md files that ensure repeatable results, whether the work is done by a person or by AI.\\nAgent memory files: Preserve knowledge across sessions through .memory.md files.\\nContext helper files: Optimize information retrieval through .context.md files.\\nHow using a core agent primitive can transform a prompt and its outcome\\nTechnique: Using Markdown prompt engineering, your prompt can be: \u201cImplement secure user authentication system\u201d\xa0\\nPrimitives: You\u2019ll select backend-dev chat mode \u2192 Auto-triggers security.instructions.md via applyTo: \\"auth/**\\" \u2192 Loads context from [Previous auth patterns](.memory.md#security) and [API Security Standards](api-security.context.md#rest) \u2192 Generates user-auth.spec.md using structured templates \u2192 Executes implement-from-spec.prompt.md workflow with validation gates.\\nOutcome: Developer-driven knowledge accumulation where you capture implementation failures in .memory.md, document successful patterns in .instructions.md, and refine workflows in .prompt.md files\u2014creating compound intelligence that improves through your iterative refinement.\\nThis transformation might seem complex, but notice the pattern: What started as an ad-hoc request became a systematic workflow with clear handoff points, automatic context loading, and built-in validation.\xa0\\nWhen you use these files and modules, you can keep adjusting and improving how your AI agent works at every step. Every time you iterate, you make your agent a little more reliable and consistent. And this isn\u2019t just random trial and error \u2014 you\u2019re following a structured, repeatable approach that helps you get better and more predictable results every time you use the AI.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Native VS Code support: While VS Code natively supports .instructions.md, .prompt.md, and .chatmode.md files, this framework takes things further with .spec.md, .memory.md, and .context.md patterns that unlock even more exciting possibilities AI-powered software development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith your prompts structured and your agentic primitives set up, you may encounter a new challenge: Even the best prompts and primitives can fail when they\u2019re faced with irrelevant context or they\u2019re competing for limited AI attention. The third layer, which we\u2019ll get to next, addresses this through strategic context management.\\nLayer 3: Context engineering: Helping your AI agents focus on what matters\\nJust like people, LLMs have finite limited memory (context windows), and can sometimes be forgetful. If you can be strategic about the context you give them, you can help them focus on what\u2019s relevant and enable them to get started and work quicker. This helps them preserve valuable context window space and improve their reliability and effectiveness.\\nHere are some techniques to make sure they get the right context\u2014this is called context engineering:\xa0\\nSession splitting: Use distinct agent sessions for different development phases and tasks. For example, use one session for planning, one for implementation, and one for testing. If an agent has fresh context, it\u2019ll have better focus. It\u2019s always better to have a fresh context window for complex tasks.\xa0\\nModular and custom rules and instructions: Apply only relevant instructions through targeted .instructions.md files using applyTo YAML frontmatter syntax. This preserves context space for actual work and reduces irrelevant suggestions.\xa0\\nMemory-driven development: Leverage agent memory through .memory.md files to maintain project knowledge and decisions across sessions and time.\\nContext optimization: Use .context.md context helper files strategically to accelerate information retrieval and reduce cognitive load.\xa0\\nCognitive focus optimization: Use chat modes in .chatmode.md files to keep the AI\u2019s attention on relevant domains and prevent cross-domain interference. Less context pollution means you\u2019ll have more consistent and accurate outputs.\xa0\\nAgentic workflows: The complete system in action\\nNow that you understand all three layers, you can see how they combine into agentic workflows\u2014complete, systematic processes where all of your agentic primitives are working together, understanding your prompts, and using only the context they need.\xa0\xa0\\nThese agentic workflows can be implemented as .prompt.md files that coordinate multiple agentic primitives into processes, designed to work whether executed locally in your IDE, in your terminal or in your CI pipelines.\\nNeed a recap?\xa0\\nMarkdown prompt engineering provides the structural foundation for predictable AI interactions.\\nAgent primitives are your configurable tools that scale and systematize these techniques.\\nContext engineering optimizes AI cognitive performance within memory constraints.\\nAgentic workflows in Markdown apply prompt and context engineering that leverages agent primitives to implement complete, reliable agentic processes.\\nThis framework creates compound intelligence that improves as you continue to iterate.\\nTooling: how to scale agent primitives\\nNow that you understand the three-layer framework and that the agentic primitives are essentially executable software written in natural language, the question is: How can you scale these Markdown files beyond your individual development workflow?\\nNatural language as code\\nThe answer mirrors every programming ecosystem\u2019s evolution. Just like JavaScript evolved from browser scripts to using Node.js runtimes, package managers, and deployment tooling, agent primitives need similar infrastructure to reach their full potential.\\nThis isn\u2019t just a metaphor: These .prompt.md and .instructions.md files represent a genuine new form of software development that requires proper tooling infrastructure.\\nHere\u2019s what we mean: Think of your agent primitives as real pieces of software, just written in natural language instead of code. They have all the same qualities: You can break complex tasks into smaller pieces (modularity), use the same instructions in multiple places (reusability), rely on other tools or files (dependencies), keep improving and updating them (evolution), and share them across teams (distribution).\\nThat said, your natural language programs are going to need the same infrastructure support as any other software.\xa0\xa0\\nAgent CLI runtimes\\nMost developers start by creating and running agent primitives directly in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, which is ideal for interactive development, debugging, and refining daily workflows. However, when you want to move beyond the editor\u2014to automate your workflows, schedule them, or integrate them into larger systems\u2014you need agent CLI runtimes like Copilot CLI.\xa0\\nThese runtimes let you execute your agent primitives from the command line and tap into advanced model capabilities. This shift unlocks automation, scaling, and seamless integration into production environments, taking your natural language programs from personal tools to powerful, shareable solutions.\xa0\\nInner loop vs. outer loop\\nInner loop (VS Code and GitHub Copilot): Interactive development, testing, and workflow refinement\\nOuter loop (agent CLI runtimes): Reproducible execution, CI/CD integration, and production deployment\\nAgent CLI Runtimes transform your agent primitives from IDE-bound files into independently executable workflows that run consistently across any environment. They provide command-line execution, CI/CD integration, environment consistency, and native support for MCP servers, which bridge your development work to production reality.\\nTL;DR: Use the inner loop for rapid, interactive work and the outer loop for reliable, repeatable automation and deployment.\\nRuntime management\\nWhile VS Code and GitHub Copilot handle individual development, some teams may want additional infrastructure for sharing, versioning, and productizing their agent primitives. Managing multiple Agent CLI runtimes can become complex quickly, with different installation procedures, configuration requirements, and compatibility matrices.\\nAPM (Agent Package Manager) solves this by providing unified runtime management and package distribution. Instead of manually installing and configuring each vendor CLI, APM handles the complexity while preserving your existing VS Code workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s how runtime management works in practice:\\n# Install APM once\\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmeppiel/apm/main/install.sh | sh\\n\\n# Optional: setup your GitHub PAT to use GitHub Copilot CLI\\nexport GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT=your_token_here\\n\\n# APM manages runtime installation for you\\napm runtime setup copilot          # Installs GitHub Copilot CLI\\napm runtime setup codex            # Installs OpenAI Codex CLI\\n\\n# Install MCP dependencies (like npm install)\\napm install\\n\\n# Compile Agent Primitive files to Agents.md files\\napm compile\\n\\n# Run workflows against your chosen runtime\\n# This will trigger \'copilot -p security-review.prompt.md\' command \\n# Check the example apm.yml file a bit below in this guide\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\\nAs you can see, your daily development stays exactly the same in VS Code, APM installs and configures runtimes automatically, your workflows run regardless of which runtime is installed, and the same apm run command works consistently across all runtimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDistribution and packaging\\nAgent primitives\u2019 similarities to traditional software become most apparent when you get to the point of wanting to share them with your team or deploying them into production\u2014when you start to require things like package management, dependency resolution, version control, and distribution mechanisms.\\nHere\u2019s the challenge: You\u2019ve built powerful agent primitives in VS Code and your team wants to use them, but distributing Markdown files and ensuring consistent MCP dependencies across different environments becomes unwieldy. You need the equivalent of npm for natural language programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM provides this missing layer. It doesn\u2019t replace your VS Code workflow\u2014it extends it by creating distributable packages of agent primitives complete with dependencies, configuration, and runtime compatibility that teams can share, just like npm packages.\\nPackage management in practice\\n# Initialize new APM project (like npm init)\\napm init security-review-workflow\\n\\n# Develop and test your workflow locally\\ncd security-review-workflow \\napm compile && apm install\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\\n\\n# Package for distribution (future: apm publish)\\n# Share apm.yml and Agent Primitive files with team\\n# Team members can install and use your primitives\\ngit clone your-workflow-repo\\ncd your-workflow-repo && apm compile && apm install\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=456\\nThe benefits compound quickly: You can distribute tested workflows as versioned packages with dependencies, automatically resolve and install required MCP servers, track workflow evolution and maintain compatibility across updates, build on (and contribute to) shared libraries from the community, and ensure everyone\u2019s running the same thing.\\nProject configuration\\nThe following\xa0 apm.yml configuration file serves as the package.json equivalent for agent primitives, defining scripts, dependencies, and input parameters:\\n# apm.yml - Project configuration (like package.json)\\nname: security-review-workflow\\nversion: 1.2.0\\ndescription: Comprehensive security review process with GitHub integration\\n\\nscripts:\\n  copilot-sec-review: \\"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  codex-sec-review: \\"codex security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  copilot-debug: \\"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  \\ndependencies:\\n  mcp:\\n    - ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\\nWith this, your agent primitives can now be packaged as distributable software with managed dependencies.\\nProduction deployment\\nThe final piece of the tooling ecosystem enables continuous AI: packaged agent primitives can now run automatically in the same CI/CD pipelines you use every day, bringing your carefully developed workflows into your production environment.\\nUsing APM GitHub Action, and building on the security-review-workflow package example above, here\u2019s how the same APM project deploys to production with multi-runtime flexibility:\\n# .github/workflows/security-review.yml\\nname: AI Security Review Pipeline\\non: \\n  pull_request:\\n    types: [opened, synchronize]\\n\\njobs:\\n  security-analysis:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    strategy:\\n      matrix:\\n        # Maps to apm.yml scripts\\n        script: [copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug]  \\n    permissions:\\n      models: read\\n      pull-requests: write\\n      contents: read\\n    \\n    steps:\\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\\n    \\n    - name: Run Security Review (${{ matrix.script }})\\n      uses: danielmeppiel/action-apm-cli@v1\\n      with:\\n        script: ${{ matrix.script }}\\n        parameters: |\\n          {\\n            \\"pr_id\\": \\"${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\\"\\n          }\\n      env:\\n        GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT: ${{ secrets.COPILOT_CLI_PAT }}\\nKey connection: The matrix.script values (copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug) correspond exactly to the scripts defined in the apm.yml configuration above. APM automatically installs the MCP dependencies (ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server) and passes the input parameters (pr_id) to your security-review.prompt.md workflow.\\nHere\u2019s why this matters:\xa0\\nAutomation: Your AI workflows now run on their own, without anyone needing to manually trigger them.\\nReliability: They run with the same consistency and reproducibility as traditional code deployments.\\nFlexibility: You can run different versions or types of analysis (mapped to different scripts) as needed.\\nIntegration: These workflows become part of your organization\u2019s standard CI/CD pipelines, just like regular software quality checks.\\nThis setup ultimately means your agent primitives are no longer just local experiments\u2014they are fully automated tools that you can rely on as part of your software delivery process, running in CI/CD whenever needed, with all dependencies and parameters managed for you.\\nEcosystem evolution\\nThis progression follows the same predictable pattern as every successful programming ecosystem. Understanding this pattern helps you see where AI-native development is heading and how to position your work strategically.\\nThe evolution happens in four stages:\\nRaw Code \u2192 agent primitives (.prompt.md, .instructions.md files)\\nRuntime environments \u2192 Agent CLI runtimes\xa0\\nPackage management \u2192 APM (distribution and orchestration layer)\\nThriving ecosystem \u2192 Shared libraries, tools, and community packages\\nJust as npm enabled JavaScript\u2019s explosive growth by solving the package distribution problem, APM enables the agent primitive ecosystem to flourish by providing the missing infrastructure layer that makes sharing and scaling natural language programs practical.\\nThe transformation is profound: what started as individual Markdown files in your editor becomes a systematic software development practice with proper tooling, distribution, and production deployment capabilities.\\nKey takeaways\\nAgent primitives are software: Your .prompt.md and .instructions.md files represent executable natural language programs that deserve professional tooling infrastructure.\\nRuntime diversity enables scale: Agent CLI runtimes provide the execution environments that bridge development to production.\\nPackage management is critical: APM provides the npm-equivalent layer that makes agent primitives truly portable and shareable.\\nProduction ready today: This tooling stack enables automated AI workflows in CI/CD pipelines with enterprise-grade reliability.\\nEcosystem growth pattern: Package management infrastructure creates the foundation for thriving ecosystems of shared workflows, tools, and community libraries.\\nHow to get started with building your first agent primitive\\nNow it\u2019s time to build your first agent primitives. Here\u2019s the plan:\xa0\\nStart with instructions: Write clear instructions that tell the AI exactly what you want it to do and how it should behave.\\nAdd chat modes: Set up special rules (chat modes) to create safe boundaries for the AI, making sure it interacts in the way you want and avoids unwanted behavior.\\nBuild reusable prompts: Create prompt templates for tasks you do often, so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch each time. These templates help the AI handle common jobs quickly and consistently.\\nCreate specification templates: Make templates that help you plan out what you want your AI to accomplish, then turn those plans into actionable steps the AI can follow.\\nInstructions architecture\\nInstructions form the bedrock of reliable AI behavior: They\u2019re the rules that guide the agent without cluttering your immediate context. Rather than repeating the same guidance in every conversation, instructions embed your team\u2019s knowledge directly into the AI\u2019s reasoning process.\\nThe key insight is modularity: instead of one massive instruction file that applies everywhere, you can create targeted files that activate only when working with specific technologies or file types. This context engineering approach keeps your AI focused and your guidance relevant.\\n\u2705 Quick actions:\\nCreate the general copilot-instructions.md file in the .github folder for the repository with common rules.\\nCreate modular .instructions.md files in the .github/instructions/ folder by domain (frontend, backend, testing, docs, specs\u2026).\\nUse applyTo: \\"**/*.{js,ts...}\\" patterns for selective application.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 copilot-instructions.md          # Global repository rules\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 instructions/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend.instructions.md     # applyTo: \\"**/*.{jsx,tsx,css}\\"\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend.instructions.md      # applyTo: \\"**/*.{py,go,java}\\"\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 testing.instructions.md      # applyTo: \\"**/test/**\\"\\nExample: Markdown prompt engineering in Instructions with frontend.instructions.md:\\n---\\napplyTo: \\"**/*.{ts,tsx}\\"\\ndescription: \\"TypeScript development guidelines with context engineering\\"\\n---\\n# TypeScript Development Guidelines\\n\\n\\n## Context Loading\\nReview [project conventions](../docs/conventions.md) and \\n[type definitions](../types/index.ts) before starting.\\n\\n\\n## Deterministic Requirements\\n- Use strict TypeScript configuration\\n- Implement error boundaries for React components\\n- Apply ESLint TypeScript rules consistently\\n\\n\\n## Structured Output\\nGenerate code with:\\n- [ ] JSDoc comments for all public APIs\\n- [ ] Unit tests in `__tests__/` directory\\n- [ ] Type exports in appropriate index files\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Checkpoint: Instructions are context-efficient and non-conflicting.\\nChat modes configuration\\nWith your instruction architecture in place, you still need a way to enforce domain boundaries and prevent AI agents from overstepping their expertise. Chat modes solve this by creating professional boundaries similar to real-world licensing. For example, you\u2019d want your architect to plan a bridge and not build it themself.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s how to set those boundaries:\xa0\\nDefine domain-specific custom chat modes with MCP tool boundaries.\\nEncapsulate tech stack knowledge and guidelines per mode.\\nDefine the most appropriate LLM model for your chat mode.\\nConfigure secure MCP tool access to prevent cross-domain security breaches.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Security through MCP tool boundaries: Each chat mode receives only the specific MCP tools needed for their domain. Giving each chat mode only the tools it needs keeps your AI workflows safe, organized, and professionally separated\u2014just like real-world roles and permissions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 chatmodes/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 architect.chatmode.md             # Planning specialist - designs, cannot execute\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend-engineer.chatmode.md     # UI specialist - builds interfaces, no backend access\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend-engineer.chatmode.md      # API specialist - builds services, no UI modification\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 technical-writer.chatmode.md      # Documentation specialist - writes docs, cannot run code\\nExample: Creating MCP tool boundaries with backend-engineer.chatmode.md:\\n---\\ndescription: \'Backend development specialist with security focus\'\\ntools: [\'changes\', \'codebase\', \'editFiles\', \'runCommands\', \'runTasks\', \\n        \'search\', \'problems\', \'testFailure\', \'terminalLastCommand\']\\nmodel: Claude Sonnet 4\\n---\\nYou are a backend development specialist focused on secure API development, database design, and server-side architecture.

These can be executed locally or delegated to independent agents. Here\u2019s how to get started:\xa0\\nCreate .prompt.md files for complete development processes.\\nBuild in mandatory human reviews.\\nDesign workflows for both local execution and independent delegation.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/prompts/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 code-review.prompt.md           # With validation checkpoints\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 feature-spec.prompt.md          # Spec-first methodology\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 async-implementation.prompt.md  # GitHub Coding Agent delegation\\nExample: Complete agentic workflow with feature-spec.prompt.md:\\n---\\nmode: agent\\nmodel: gpt-4\\ntools: [\'file-search\', \'semantic-search\', \'github\']\\ndescription: \'Feature implementation workflow with validation gates\'\\n---\\n# Feature Implementation from Specification\\n\\n\\n## Context Loading Phase\\n1.

Without a clear, consistent way to document requirements, things can get lost in translation, leading to mistakes, misunderstandings, or missed steps. This is where specification templates come in. These templates ensure that both people and AI agents can take a concept (like a new feature or API) and reliably implement it.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s what these templates help you accomplish:\xa0\\nStandardize the process: You create a new specification for each feature, API endpoint, or component.\\nProvide blueprints for implementation: These specs include everything a developer (or an AI agent) needs to know to start building: the problem, the approach, required components, validation criteria, and a checklist for handoff.\\nMake handoff deterministic: By following a standard, the transition from planning to doing is clear and predictable.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\xa0\\nSpec-kit is a neat tool that fully implements a specification-driven approach to agentic coding. It allows you to easily get started with creating specs (spec.md), an implementation plan (plan.md) and splitting that into actual tasks (tasks.md) ready for developers or coding agents to work on.\\n\u26a0\ufe0f \ufe0fCheckpoint: Specifications are split into tasks that are implementation-ready before delegation.\\nReady to go? Here\u2019s a quickstart checklist\\nYou now have a complete foundation for systematic AI development. The checklist below walks through the implementation sequence, building toward creating complete agentic workflows.\\nConceptual foundation\\nUnderstand Markdown prompt engineering principles (semantic structure, precision, and tools).\\nGrasp context engineering fundamentals (context window optimization and session strategy).\\nImplementation steps\\nCreate .github/copilot-instructions.md with basic project guidelines (context engineering: global rules).\\nSet up domain-specific .instructions.md files with applyTo patterns (context engineering: selective loading).\\nConfigure chat modes for your tech stack domains (context engineering: domain boundaries).\\nCreate your first .prompt.md agentic workflow.\\nBuild your first .spec.md template for feature specifications (you can use spec-kit for this).\\nPractice a spec-driven approach with session splitting: plan first, split into tasks, and lastly, implement.\\nTake this with you\\nWorking with AI agents shouldn\u2019t have to be unpredictable. With the right planning and tools, these agents can quickly become a reliable part of your workflow and processes\u2014boosting not only your own productivity, but your team\u2019s too.\xa0\\nReady for the next phase of multi-agent coordination delegation?

(2) From each malware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics. Since the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity checking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique that produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly items and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from the malware\'s assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical vectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which allows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet employs state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense communities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our extensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the coverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its runtime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions."},{"creator":"Aleksandar Petrov, Pierre Fernandez, Tom\\\\\'a\\\\v{s} Sou\\\\v{c}ek, Hady Elsahar","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","title":"We Can Hide More Bits: The Unused Watermarking Capacity in Theory and in Practice","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12812","pubDate":"Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400","dc:creator":"Aleksandar Petrov, Pierre Fernandez, Tom\\\\\'a\\\\v{s} Sou\\\\v{c}ek, Hady Elsahar","description":"arXiv:2510.12812v1 Announce Type: new \\nAbstract: Despite rapid progress in deep learning-based image watermarking, the capacity of current robust methods remains limited to the scale of only a few hundred bits.

In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and unsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping.

Since the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity checking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique that produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly items and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from the malware\'s assembly code.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on <em>real</em> repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.</p>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"from-idea-to-merge-in-record-time-%e2%9a%a1\\">From idea to merge in record time &#9889;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext-edit suggestions: Copilot predicts the next change you\u2019ll make and offers it inline. One Tab and you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow-latency completions: Most Copilot responses now render in under 400 ms (fast enough that you stop noticing them).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopilot CLI: The same brains, now in your terminal. Setup, debug, and script without switching windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMulti-model routing: Different jobs call for different brains. Copilot gives you access to multiple LLMs from leading frontier AI firms.\xa0\\nThe result: fewer interruptions, faster loops, and a workflow that finally keeps pace with how you think.\\nAI that scales with your workflow \ud83d\udcd0\\nCopilot doesn\u2019t live in a new environment you need to learn. It\u2019s part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\xa0\\nJetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity: Same Copilot, wherever you build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom instructions: Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGitHub MCP Server: Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkspace prompt files: Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20M+ developers strong: Every Copilot update compounds through the world\u2019s largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\\nCopilot isn\u2019t a separate tool you \u201cadd\u201d to GitHub. It\u2019s part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\\nSmarter, cleaner, and safer code \ud83d\udd0d\\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know).

In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.</p>\\n<p>Linux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt. Mint and other flavors of Linux come with <strong>LibreOffice</strong>, which is an open source suite of tools that includes applications similar to Microsoft Office, and it can open, edit and save documents as Microsoft Office files.</p>\\n<p>If you\u2019d prefer to give Linux a test drive before installing it on a Windows PC, you can always just download it to a removable USB drive. From there, reboot the computer (with the removable drive plugged in) and select the option at startup to run the operating system from the external USB drive. If you don\u2019t see an option for that after restarting, try restarting again and hitting the F8 button, which should open a list of bootable drives.\xa0<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qZI6i21jB4\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Here\u2019s a fairly thorough tutorial</a>\xa0that walks through exactly how to do all this.</p>\\n<p>And if this is your first time trying out Linux, relax and have fun: The nice thing about a \u201clive\u201d version of Linux (as it\u2019s called when the operating system is run from a removable drive such as a CD or a USB stick) is that none of your changes persist after a reboot.

But with a threat score of 9.8 out of possible 10 and marked \u201cexploitation more likely,\u201d CVE-2025-59287 can be exploited without authentication and is an easy \u201cpatch now\u201d candidate.\\n\u201cMicrosoft provides limited information, stating that an unauthenticated attacker with network access can send untrusted data to the WSUS server, resulting in deserialization and code execution,\u201d Breen wrote. \u201cAs WSUS is a trusted Windows service that is designed to update privileged files across the file system, an attacker would have free rein over the operating system and could potentially bypass some EDR detections that ignore or exclude the WSUS service.\u201d\\nFor more on other fixes from Redmond today, check out the SANS Internet Storm Center monthly roundup, which indexes all of the updates by severity and urgency.\\nWindows 10 isn\u2019t the only Microsoft OS that is reaching end-of-life today;\xa0Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Skype for Business 2016, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2, and Outlook 2016 are some of the other products that Microsoft is sunsetting today.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re running any Windows 10 systems, you\u2019ve probably already determined whether your PC meets the technical hardware specs recommended for the Windows 11 OS. If you\u2019re reluctant or unable to migrate a Windows 10 system to Windows 11, there are alternatives to simply continuing to use Windows 10 without ongoing security updates.\\nOne option is to pay for another year\u2019s worth of security updates through Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. The cost is just $30 if you don\u2019t have a Microsoft account, and apparently free if you register the PC to a Microsoft account. This video breakdown from Ask Your Computer Guy does a good job of walking Windows 10 users through this process. Microsoft emphasizes that ESU enrollment does not provide other types of fixes, feature improvements or product enhancements. It also does not come with technical support.\\n\\nIf your Windows 10 system is associated with a Microsoft account and signed in when you visit Windows Update, you should see an option to enroll in extended updates. Image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZH7MlvOoPM\\n\\nWindows 10 users also have the option of installing some flavor of Linux instead. Anyone seriously considering this option should check out the website endof10.org, which includes a plethora of tips and a DIY installation guide.\\nLinux Mint is a great option for Linux newbies. Like most modern Linux versions, Mint will run on anything with a 64-bit CPU that has at least 2GB of memory, although 4GB is recommended. In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.\\nLinux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt. Mint and other flavors of Linux come with LibreOffice, which is an open source suite of tools that includes applications similar to Microsoft Office, and it can open, edit and save documents as Microsoft Office files.\\nIf you\u2019d prefer to give Linux a test drive before installing it on a Windows PC, you can always just download it to a removable USB drive. From there, reboot the computer (with the removable drive plugged in) and select the option at startup to run the operating system from the external USB drive. If you don\u2019t see an option for that after restarting, try restarting again and hitting the F8 button, which should open a list of bootable drives.\xa0Here\u2019s a fairly thorough tutorial\xa0that walks through exactly how to do all this.\\nAnd if this is your first time trying out Linux, relax and have fun: The nice thing about a \u201clive\u201d version of Linux (as it\u2019s called when the operating system is run from a removable drive such as a CD or a USB stick) is that none of your changes persist after a reboot. Even if you somehow manage to break something, a restart will return the system back to its original state.\\nAs ever, if you experience any difficulties during or after applying this month\u2019s batch of patches, please leave a note about it in the comments below.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/patch-tuesday-october-2025-end-of-10-edition/#comments","description":"Microsoft today released software updates to plug a whopping 172 security holes in its Windows operating systems, including at least three vulnerabilities that are already being actively exploited.

We&rsquo;re talking about <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#\\">COBOL</a>, a programming language that&rsquo;s been around for 65 years. That&rsquo;s older than the internet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here&rsquo;s the thing&mdash;COBOL isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. In fact, it&rsquo;s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem? <strong>Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns.</strong> The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-meet-the-developer-who-s-modernizing-cobol-without-learning-cobol\\">Meet the developer who&rsquo;s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I recently spoke with <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-kordick/\\">Julia Kordick</a>, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who&rsquo;s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What&rsquo;s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Julia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn&rsquo;t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions.

Here&rsquo;s what that looks like:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Translation:</strong> If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Structural analysis: </strong>COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you&rsquo;ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they&rsquo;re predictable. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>COBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>ENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>DATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>PROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ask GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you.

You don&rsquo;t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL&rsquo;s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Documentation as source of truth:</strong> Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: &ldquo;Everything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>&#128161;Pro tip:</strong> COBOL&rsquo;s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like <code>ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE</code> are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"step-3-automation-aids-scaling-the-process\\">Step 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Julia&rsquo;s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what this orchestration looks like in practice:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Call chain mapping:</strong> Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Test-driven modernization:</strong> Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Dependency optimization:</strong> Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you&rsquo;re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Think of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>&#128161;Pro tip:</strong> Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes.

It&rsquo;s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that&rsquo;s unmaintainable. I&rsquo;ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don&rsquo;t understand in a language they&rsquo;re still learning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI-powered approach changes this.

We\u2019re talking about COBOL, a programming language that\u2019s been around for 65 years. That\u2019s older than the internet.\\nNow, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014COBOL isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, it\u2019s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.\\nThe problem? Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns. The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.\\nBut here\u2019s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.\\nMeet the developer who\u2019s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)\\nI recently spoke with Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who\u2019s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What\u2019s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.\\nJulia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn\u2019t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions. The COBOL experts provided the legacy system knowledge.\\nWhen this whole idea of Gen AI appeared, we were thinking about how we can actually use AI to solve this problem that has not been really solved yet.\\nJulia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt\\nThe three-step framework for AI-powered legacy modernization\\nJulia and her team at Microsoft have cracked the code (pun intended) with a systematic approach that works for any legacy modernization project, not just COBOL. Here\u2019s their GitHub Copilot powered, battle-tested framework.\\nStep 1: Code preparation (reverse engineering)\\nThe biggest problem with legacy systems? Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool. Instead of hiring consultants to spend months analyzing code, you can use AI to:\\nExtract business logic from legacy files.\\nDocument everything in markdown for human review.\\nAutomatically identify call chains and dependencies.\\nClean up irrelevant comments and historical logs.\\nAdd additional information as comments where needed.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Always have human experts review AI-generated analysis. AI is incredible at pattern recognition, but domain knowledge still matters for business context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s what GitHub Copilot generates for you:\xa0\\n# Business Logic Analysis Generated by GitHub Copilot\\n## File Inventory\\n- listings.cobol: List management functionality (~100 lines)\\n- mainframe-example.cobol: Full mainframe program (~10K lines, high complexity)\\n\\n## Business Purpose\\nCustomer account validation with balance checking\\n- Validates account numbers against master file\\n- Performs balance calculations with overdraft protection\\n- Generates transaction logs for audit compliance\\n\\n## Dependencies Discovered\\n- DB2 database connections via SQLCA\\n- External validation service calls\\n- Legacy print queue system\\nStep 2: Enrichment (making code AI-digestible)\\nYou usually need to add context to help AI understand your code better. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\\nTranslation: If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.\\nStructural analysis: COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you\u2019ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they\u2019re predictable. Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL\u2019s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.\\nDocumentation as source of truth: Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: \u201cEverything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.\u201d\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: COBOL\u2019s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid chart example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality check: It\u2019s not a silver bullet\\nJulia\u2019s brutally honest about limitations:\\nEveryone who\u2019s currently promising you, \u2018hey, I can solve all your mainframe problems with just one click\u2019 is lying to you.\\nThe reality is:\\nHumans must stay in the loop for validation.\\nEach COBOL codebase is unique and complex.\\nWe\u2019re early in the agentic AI journey.\\nFull automation is probably at least five years away.\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make massive progress today.\\nSee it in action: the Azure samples framework\\nJulia and her team have open-sourced their entire framework. It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt. It\u2019s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.\\nThe traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that\u2019s unmaintainable. I\u2019ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don\u2019t understand in a language they\u2019re still learning.\\nThe AI-powered approach changes this. You use AI to understand business logic, generate human-readable modern code, and maintain control of your intellectual property. Your team stays involved throughout the process. They learn the business logic as they go. The code that comes out the other end is something your developers can actually work with.\\nJulia explained the shift:\\nWhat a lot of customers do not want to actually give all their intellectual property like a hundred percent to a partner anymore, right? They want to keep it in check.\\nStart here: your path to becoming the modernization hero\\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with COBOL, ancient Java, or any legacy system, here\u2019s how you can start today:\\nStart small\\nIdentify one problematic legacy system (start with fewer than 5,000 lines)\\nUse GitHub Copilot to analyze a single file\\nDocument what you discover in markdown\\nShare findings with your team\\nBuild your AI toolkit\\nExperiment with the Azure Samples framework\\nLearn prompt engineering for code analysis (try: \u201cAnalyze this COBOL program and explain its business purpose in simple terms\u201d)\\nPractice iterative modernization techniques\\nThink beyond code\\nConsider nonfunctional requirements for cloud-native design\\nPlan for distributed systems architecture\\nRemember: most COBOL programs are doing simple CRUD operations. They don\u2019t need the complexity of a mainframe. They need the simplicity of modern architecture.\\nHere\u2019s a challenge: Find a legacy system in your organization. Six-month-old code counts as legacy in our industry. Try using GitHub Copilot to:\\nGenerate business logic documentation\\nIdentify potential modernization opportunities\\nCreate a migration plan with human validation checkpoints\\nShare your results on LinkedIn and tag me. I\u2019d love to see what you discover.\\nThe best time to start is now\\nThe most powerful insight from my conversation with Julia is this: AI doesn\u2019t replace developer expertise. It amplifies it.\\nCOBOL experts bring irreplaceable domain knowledge. Modern developers bring fresh perspectives on architecture and best practices. AI brings pattern recognition and translation capabilities at scale.\\nWhen these three forces work together, legacy modernization transforms from an impossible challenge into an achievable project.\\nThe best time to modernize legacy code was 10 years ago.

For years, the conventional wisdom was to move your data to where the AI models are. Oracle is flipping that on its head, arguing that it\u2019s far more secure and efficient to bring the AI to your data. This latest database release is the embodiment of that &#8220;AI for Data&#8221; vision.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Juan Loaiza, Executive VP of Oracle Database Technologies at Oracle, said: \u201cBy architecting AI and data together, Oracle AI Database makes \u2018AI for Data\u2019 simple to learn and simple to use. We enable our customers to easily deliver trusted AI insights, innovations, and productivity for all their data, everywhere, including both operational systems and analytic data lakes.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the standout features is the ability to run agentic AI workflows inside your database. The AI agents can tackle complex questions by combining your enterprise&#8217;s private, sensitive data with public information, all without ever having to move that private data outside your secure environment. This is made possible by features like a Unified Hybrid Vector Search, which lets the AI look for context across all your data types, whether it&#8217;s in a relational table, a JSON file, or a spatial map.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oracle is also clearly thinking about the long game with security. The new database implements NIST-approved quantum-resistant algorithms for data both in-flight and at-rest. It\u2019s a defence against &#8220;harvest now, decrypt later&#8221; attacks, where hackers steal encrypted data today with the hope of breaking it with future quantum computers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Holger Mueller, VP and Principal Analyst at <a href=\\"https://www.constellationr.com/\\">Constellation Research</a>, commented: \u201cGreat AI needs great data. With Oracle AI Database 26ai, customers get both. It\u2019s the single place where their business data lives\u2014current, consistent, and secure. And it\u2019s the best place to use AI on that data without moving it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201cTo help simplify and accelerate AI adoption, AI Database 26ai includes impressive new AI features that go beyond AI Vector Search. A highlight is Oracle\u2019s architecting agentic AI into the database, enabling customers to build, deploy, and manage their own in-database AI agents using a no-code visual platform that includes pre-built agents.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The new database is designed to work with NVIDIA&#8217;s toolset. Its programming interfaces can now plug directly into NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, a collection of microservices that handle the complicated plumbing of modern AI for an enterprise.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This makes it far easier for developers to implement things like retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. In simple terms, RAG allows a language model to look up relevant facts in your company documents before it answers a question, making its responses far more accurate and useful.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Oracle Private AI Services Container will also get a GPU-powered boost. This container lets businesses run AI models in their own secure environment. Soon, it will be able to offload the heavy lifting of creating vector embeddings \u2013 a core task for AI search \u2013 to powerful NVIDIA GPUs using the cuVS library. This promises to slash the time it takes to prepare data for AI applications.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-democratising-enterprise-ai\\">Democratising enterprise AI</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Beyond the database, the partnership aims to simplify the entire AI pipeline. The new Oracle AI Data Platform now includes a built-in NVIDIA GPU option and the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark. For data scientists and engineers, this is a big deal. It means they can speed up their data processing and machine learning workflows using GPUs, often without having to change a single line of their existing code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of these tools and capabilities are being consolidated within the Oracle AI Hub. The idea is to give organisations a single place to build, deploy, and manage their AI solutions. From the hub, users can deploy NVIDIA&#8217;s NIM microservices \u2013 which are like pre-packaged AI skills \u2013 through a simple, no-code interface.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To lower the barrier to entry even further, the full NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite is now natively available within the OCI Console. This means that a developer can spin up a GPU instance and enable all the necessary NVIDIA tools with a few clicks, rather than going through a separate procurement process. It\u2019s a small change that makes a big difference in how quickly teams can get started.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that this collaboration is aimed at solving the real-world challenges businesses face when trying to adopt AI. By bringing the hardware, the data, and the software tools into one cohesive ecosystem, Oracle and NVIDIA are making a case that the era of practical, secure, and scalable enterprise AI has well and truly arrived.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/cisco-only-13-percent-solid-ai-strategy-and-lapping-rivals/\\"><strong>Cisco: Only 13% have a solid AI strategy and they\u2019re lapping rivals</strong></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\\"><a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\\"><img fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"728\\" height=\\"90\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\\" alt=\\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\\" class=\\"wp-image-109805\\" style=\\"width:800px;height:auto\\" srcset=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\" /></a></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The real substance of this partnership lies in the software integrations that aim to weave AI into every layer of a business\u2019s operations.\\nMahesh Thiagarajan, Executive VP of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, commented: \u201cOCI Zettascale10 delivers multi\u2011gigawatt capacity for the most challenging AI workloads with NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU platform.\\n\u201cIn addition, the native availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise on OCI gives our joint customers a leading AI toolset close at hand to OCI\u2019s 200+ cloud services, supporting a long tail of customer innovation.\u201d\\nGiving your Oracle database a brain with AI\\nThe foundation of this new strategy is the Oracle AI Database 26ai. For years, the conventional wisdom was to move your data to where the AI models are. Oracle is flipping that on its head, arguing that it\u2019s far more secure and efficient to bring the AI to your data. This latest database release is the embodiment of that \u201cAI for Data\u201d vision.\\nJuan Loaiza, Executive VP of Oracle Database Technologies at Oracle, said: \u201cBy architecting AI and data together, Oracle AI Database makes \u2018AI for Data\u2019 simple to learn and simple to use. We enable our customers to easily deliver trusted AI insights, innovations, and productivity for all their data, everywhere, including both operational systems and analytic data lakes.\u201d\\nOne of the standout features is the ability to run agentic AI workflows inside your database. The AI agents can tackle complex questions by combining your enterprise\u2019s private, sensitive data with public information, all without ever having to move that private data outside your secure environment. This is made possible by features like a Unified Hybrid Vector Search, which lets the AI look for context across all your data types, whether it\u2019s in a relational table, a JSON file, or a spatial map.\\nOracle is also clearly thinking about the long game with security. The new database implements NIST-approved quantum-resistant algorithms for data both in-flight and at-rest. It\u2019s a defence against \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks, where hackers steal encrypted data today with the hope of breaking it with future quantum computers.\\nHolger Mueller, VP and Principal Analyst at Constellation Research, commented: \u201cGreat AI needs great data. With Oracle AI Database 26ai, customers get both. It\u2019s the single place where their business data lives\u2014current, consistent, and secure. And it\u2019s the best place to use AI on that data without moving it.\\n\u201cTo help simplify and accelerate AI adoption, AI Database 26ai includes impressive new AI features that go beyond AI Vector Search. A highlight is Oracle\u2019s architecting agentic AI into the database, enabling customers to build, deploy, and manage their own in-database AI agents using a no-code visual platform that includes pre-built agents.\u201d\\nThe new database is designed to work with NVIDIA\u2019s toolset. Its programming interfaces can now plug directly into NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, a collection of microservices that handle the complicated plumbing of modern AI for an enterprise.\\nThis makes it far easier for developers to implement things like retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. In simple terms, RAG allows a language model to look up relevant facts in your company documents before it answers a question, making its responses far more accurate and useful.\\nThe Oracle Private AI Services Container will also get a GPU-powered boost. This container lets businesses run AI models in their own secure environment. Soon, it will be able to offload the heavy lifting of creating vector embeddings \u2013 a core task for AI search \u2013 to powerful NVIDIA GPUs using the cuVS library. This promises to slash the time it takes to prepare data for AI applications.\\nDemocratising enterprise AI\\nBeyond the database, the partnership aims to simplify the entire AI pipeline. The new Oracle AI Data Platform now includes a built-in NVIDIA GPU option and the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark. For data scientists and engineers, this is a big deal. It means they can speed up their data processing and machine learning workflows using GPUs, often without having to change a single line of their existing code.\\nAll of these tools and capabilities are being consolidated within the Oracle AI Hub. The idea is to give organisations a single place to build, deploy, and manage their AI solutions. From the hub, users can deploy NVIDIA\u2019s NIM microservices \u2013 which are like pre-packaged AI skills \u2013 through a simple, no-code interface.\\nTo lower the barrier to entry even further, the full NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite is now natively available within the OCI Console. This means that a developer can spin up a GPU instance and enable all the necessary NVIDIA tools with a few clicks, rather than going through a separate procurement process. It\u2019s a small change that makes a big difference in how quickly teams can get started.\\nIt\u2019s clear that this collaboration is aimed at solving the real-world challenges businesses face when trying to adopt AI. By bringing the hardware, the data, and the software tools into one cohesive ecosystem, Oracle and NVIDIA are making a case that the era of practical, secure, and scalable enterprise AI has well and truly arrived.\\nSee also: Cisco: Only 13% have a solid AI strategy and they\u2019re lapping rivals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Adoption of security basics (security software, strong/unique passwords, multi-factor authentication, timely system updates, permission hygiene, data backups) remains low, even after painful firsthand experience. \\nHow to cut the risk\\nMost of us use our phones to shop, find deals, and pay\u2014and we deserve to be able to do that safely. Adopting preventative security measures (such as using mobile security software), practicing good mobile hygiene (such as checking app permissions), and remembering STOP, our simple scam response framework, can keep scammers at bay:\xa0\\nS\u2014Slow down: Don\u2019t let urgency or pressure push you into action. Take a breath before responding. Legitimate businesses like your bank or credit card don\u2019t push immediate action.\\nT\u2014Test them: If you answered the phone and are feeling panicked about the situation, likely involving a family member or friend, ask a question only the real person would know\u2014something that can\u2019t be found online.\xa0\xa0\\nO\u2014Opt out: If it feels off, hang up or end the conversation. You can always say the connection dropped.\\nP\u2014Prove it: Confirm the person is who they say they are by reaching out yourself through a trusted number, website, or method you\u2019ve used before.\\nThe criminals behind extortion scams pour time and money into targeting their victims, constantly evolving their tactics to make the scams more believable and hard-hitting. If you\u2019ve been the victim of an extortion scam, sharing your story can help others spot the signs before it\u2019s too late, reduce the stigma of being a victim, and put the shame where it belongs: on the criminals.\\nAs Malwarebytes Global Head of Scam and AI Research Shahak Shalev puts it:\\n\u201cIf we can remove the stigma and silence around scams, I think we can help everyone take a step back and pause before acting on one of these threats\u201d\\nWe don\u2019t just report on scams\u2014we help detect them\\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The move underscores the company\u2019s push to stay competitive as AI becomes central to enterprise software.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Founded and headquartered in San Francisco since 1999, Salesforce has been adding AI features across its products, including the workplace messaging tool Slack. The company is competing with ServiceNow, Oracle, and Microsoft to attract organisations eager to integrate AI into their operations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Part of the new investment will fund an AI incubator on Salesforce\u2019s San Francisco campus and help companies deploy AI agents \u2014 digital assistants that can handle tasks for users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201cThis $15 billion investment reflects our deep commitment to our hometown \u2014 advancing AI innovation, creating jobs and helping companies and our communities thrive,\u201d said CEO Marc Benioff.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The announcement comes just before Dreamforce, Salesforce\u2019s annual conference, which runs from October 14 to 16 in San Francisco. The company expects around 50,000 people to attend and estimates the event will bring in about $130 million in local revenue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Salesforce, which employs more than 76,000 people worldwide, also announced last week that it will spend $1 billion in Mexico over the next five years. The company has operated there since 2006.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said the new spending aligns with the company\u2019s long-term goals. \u201cIf the company wants to remain a leader in an important emerging technology area, it must have a pipeline of talent to innovate and drive the field forward. We already see shortages of AI talent, so this makes sense,\u201d he said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Salesforce shares rose 2.8% on Monday but remain down about 28% since the start of the year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the same day, Salesforce also launched Agentforce 360, a new AI platform for businesses.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While many companies are still experimenting with AI-driven automation, Salesforce says it has already rolled out multiple versions of its \u201cagentic\u201d technology, used by thousands of customers and within its own operations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The company describes the \u201cAgentic Enterprise\u201d as a workplace model where AI supports people rather than replaces them. In this setup, AI agents help teams respond faster, track leads, provide continuous service, and make better decisions. The goal, Salesforce says, is to boost productivity and customer engagement.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Agentforce 360 combines four key parts of this model:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Agentforce 360 Platform:</strong> A framework for building enterprise AI agents, now featuring a conversational builder, hybrid reasoning for more accurate results, and voice support.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Data 360:</strong> A unified data layer that gives AI systems the context they need.

The move underscores the company\u2019s push to stay competitive as AI becomes central to enterprise software.\\nFounded and headquartered in San Francisco since 1999, Salesforce has been adding AI features across its products, including the workplace messaging tool Slack. The company is competing with ServiceNow, Oracle, and Microsoft to attract organisations eager to integrate AI into their operations.\\nPart of the new investment will fund an AI incubator on Salesforce\u2019s San Francisco campus and help companies deploy AI agents \u2014 digital assistants that can handle tasks for users.\\n\u201cThis $15 billion investment reflects our deep commitment to our hometown \u2014 advancing AI innovation, creating jobs and helping companies and our communities thrive,\u201d said CEO Marc Benioff.\\nThe announcement comes just before Dreamforce, Salesforce\u2019s annual conference, which runs from October 14 to 16 in San Francisco. The company expects around 50,000 people to attend and estimates the event will bring in about $130 million in local revenue.\\nSalesforce, which employs more than 76,000 people worldwide, also announced last week that it will spend $1 billion in Mexico over the next five years. The company has operated there since 2006.\\nMorningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said the new spending aligns with the company\u2019s long-term goals. \u201cIf the company wants to remain a leader in an important emerging technology area, it must have a pipeline of talent to innovate and drive the field forward. We already see shortages of AI talent, so this makes sense,\u201d he said.\\nSalesforce shares rose 2.8% on Monday but remain down about 28% since the start of the year.\\nOn the same day, Salesforce also launched Agentforce 360, a new AI platform for businesses.\\nWhile many companies are still experimenting with AI-driven automation, Salesforce says it has already rolled out multiple versions of its \u201cagentic\u201d technology, used by thousands of customers and within its own operations.\\nThe company describes the \u201cAgentic Enterprise\u201d as a workplace model where AI supports people rather than replaces them. In this setup, AI agents help teams respond faster, track leads, provide continuous service, and make better decisions. The goal, Salesforce says, is to boost productivity and customer engagement.\\nAgentforce 360 combines four key parts of this model:\\nAgentforce 360 Platform: A framework for building enterprise AI agents, now featuring a conversational builder, hybrid reasoning for more accurate results, and voice support.\\nData 360: A unified data layer that gives AI systems the context they need. Features like Intelligent Context and Tableau Semantics help turn raw data into meaningful insights.\\nCustomer 360 Apps: The tools that record how a company sells, serves, and operates \u2014 now enhanced with AI to better understand customer behaviour and internal processes.\\nSlack: A shared space where people and AI agents can work together, linking information and actions in real time.\\nSalesforce says this setup allows businesses to build AI agents that rely on trusted data, function across departments, and integrate directly with existing workflows. Its open ecosystem also lets partners tailor the technology for different industries.\\nLast month, Salesforce forecast third-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst expectations but expanded its share buyback plan by $20 billion.\\n(Photo by Denys Nevozhai)\\nSee also: Salesforce Agentforce 3 brings visibility to AI agents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Normally, you&rsquo;d spend time reading through the README, manually checking dependencies, and combing through open issues to find a place to start. But with Copilot CLI, you can offload all of that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"1-clone-and-launch-copilot\\">1. Clone and launch Copilot</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>First things first. Grab the repository you want to work on and run Copilot CLI in your terminal.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\\"wp-block-code language-plaintext\\"><code>gh repo clone github/spec-kit\\ncd spec-kit\\ncopilot</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot greets you in the terminal. Type <code>/</code> at any time to see available commands, or use <kbd><strong>Ctrl+R</strong></kbd> to see logs of the commands Copilot has run on your behalf.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"2-get-oriented-in-a-new-codebase\\">2. Get oriented in a new codebase</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you&rsquo;re inside the project, the first step is understanding how everything fits together. Instead of scrolling through files manually or piecing it together from the README, ask Copilot to explain it for you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-video\\"><video controls poster=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-at-2.36.18-PM.png\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/explain.mp4\\"></video></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Explain the layout of this project.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot inspects the repository using find, tree, and the README, then returns a clean Markdown summary. No more hunting through nested directories trying to figure out where things live.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-3-check-your-environment\\">3. Check your environment</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After you know the lay of the land, the next question is: can you actually build it? Normally, you&rsquo;d spend time hunting for dependencies and making sure you&rsquo;ve installed the right versions. Copilot now handles that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Make sure my environment is ready to build this project.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot verifies dependencies, installs missing tools (like Go for the GitHub CLI), and confirms you can build locally. All without you having to comb through setup docs or run trial-and-error commands.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"4-find-a-good-first-issue\\">4. Find a good first issue</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;re set up, you&rsquo;ll want to start contributing. Instead of browsing through dozens of open issues, let Copilot surface the ones that make sense for you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Find good first issues in this repository and rank them by difficulty.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot queries GitHub Issues with its built-in <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-github-mcp-server-public-preview/\\">GitHub MCP server</a> and suggests a curated list, complete with difficulty levels. Instead of scanning dozens of issues, you can dive straight into a task that matches your comfort zone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"5-start-implementing\\">5. Start implementing</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now comes the real work. Normally, after finding an issue to work on, you&rsquo;d create a branch, open the right files, make edits, and double-check your changes before committing. With Copilot CLI, you can let it draft the fix for you while you stay in control at every step.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Start implementing issue #1234. Show me the diff before applying.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot drafts a plan, makes the edits, and presents the diff. You stay in control, review, and approve before changes are applied.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128064; Pro tip</strong>: You can <code>@-mention</code> files in your prompt if you want Copilot to focus on specific parts of the code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"6-commit-and-open-a-draft-pull-request\\">6. Commit and open a draft pull request&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once the changes look good, the next step is packaging them up and sharing your work. Normally, that means staging files, writing a commit message, pushing a branch, and opening a pull request, which is all a bit of a dance in Git. Copilot CLI streamlines the whole flow so you can stay focused on the code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Stage changes, write a commit referencing #1234, and open a draft PR.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot will then stage files, write the commit message, and open a draft pull request for you to review.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"7-bonus-kill-that-process-hogging-your-port\\">7. Bonus: Kill that process hogging your port</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve hit another common headache: a process hogging a port. You know, that moment when you try to start your dev server and it tells you a port (let&rsquo;s say 8080 for this example) is already in use, and you have to go hunting for the right lsof command and flags.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>What process is using port 8080? Kill it and verify the port is free.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot runs the right lsof command, shows the PID, kills the process, and verifies it&rsquo;s gone. No more Googling arcane flags or trying to remember if it&rsquo;s lsof -i :8080 or lsof -t -i:8080 or something else entirely.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;m horrible at remembering commands, especially ones I use infrequently. With Copilot CLI, I just defer these tasks straight to it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll remember the command next time, or maybe (probably) not. But I&rsquo;ll definitely ask Copilot again.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"stay-in-control\\">Stay in control</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot always asks before running commands or accessing directories. This is critical when you&rsquo;re giving an AI access to run things on your machine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before Copilot can execute anything, it will prompt you to:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>Allow once</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Allow always for this command</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Deny</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You can also:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>Use <code>/session</code> to view what&rsquo;s currently allowed</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Reset permissions at any time with <code>/reset</code></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Add directories to your allowed list with <code>/add-directory</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"extend-with-mcp-servers\\">Extend with MCP servers</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot CLI ships with the GitHub MCP server already installed and running. This is what powers the issue search and repository interactions. But you can add any MCP server you want from the registry using /mcp.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Want to add Playwright for browser testing? Or integrate with your company&rsquo;s internal tools? You can customize and extend Copilot CLI to match your workflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" height=\\"785\\" width=\\"1024\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1_8dda93.png?resize=1024%2C785\\" alt=\\"A terminal window showing the GitHub Copilot CLI interface where a user is adding a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

I spend a lot of time in the terminal anyway, jumping between repositories, checking logs, running builds. Having Copilot right there means I&rsquo;m not constantly switching contexts between my IDE, browser, and command line just to get AI help.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I&rsquo;m onboarding contributors to our projects or exploring a new codebase myself, I can stay in that flow. I can ask about the project structure, verify dependencies, find issues to work on, and start implementing without bouncing around between tools.

You clone repositories there, install dependencies, debug issues, and run builds. But until now, when you needed AI help, you had to leave the CLI and open your editor or browser. Not anymore.\\nGitHub Copilot CLI brings that same assistance straight to your shell. No switching contexts, no breaking flow. Just you, your terminal, and an AI that can actually help you get things done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall once, authenticate, and start working\\nWith Copilot CLI, you don\u2019t have to juggle your API keys. Just install the assistant, sign in with your existing GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plan, and go. \xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# 1. Install via npm\\nnpm install -g @github/copilot\\n\\n# 2. Launch Copilot CLI\\ncopilot\\n\\n# Authenticate with your GitHub account\\n/login\\nRequirements:\\nNode v22+\\nnpm version 10 or later\\nLaunch Copilot CLI\\nLog in with your GitHub account\xa0\\nFrom here, you can get hands-on immediately\u2014debugging tests, spinning up preview deploys, or writing one-off scripts\u2014without leaving your terminal.\xa0\\nUse case: From clone to pull request in the terminal\\nImagine this: You\u2019ve just cloned a repository you want to contribute to. Normally, you\u2019d spend time reading through the README, manually checking dependencies, and combing through open issues to find a place to start. But with Copilot CLI, you can offload all of that.\\n1. Clone and launch Copilot\\nFirst things first. Grab the repository you want to work on and run Copilot CLI in your terminal.\xa0\\ngh repo clone github/spec-kit\\ncd spec-kit\\ncopilot\\nCopilot greets you in the terminal. Type / at any time to see available commands, or use Ctrl+R to see logs of the commands Copilot has run on your behalf.\\n2. Get oriented in a new codebase\\nOnce you\u2019re inside the project, the first step is understanding how everything fits together. Instead of scrolling through files manually or piecing it together from the README, ask Copilot to explain it for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou say: Explain the layout of this project.\\nCopilot inspects the repository using find, tree, and the README, then returns a clean Markdown summary. No more hunting through nested directories trying to figure out where things live.\\n3. Check your environment\\nAfter you know the lay of the land, the next question is: can you actually build it? Normally, you\u2019d spend time hunting for dependencies and making sure you\u2019ve installed the right versions. Copilot now handles that.\\nYou say: Make sure my environment is ready to build this project.\\nCopilot verifies dependencies, installs missing tools (like Go for the GitHub CLI), and confirms you can build locally. All without you having to comb through setup docs or run trial-and-error commands.\\n4. Find a good first issue\\nNow that you\u2019re set up, you\u2019ll want to start contributing. Instead of browsing through dozens of open issues, let Copilot surface the ones that make sense for you.\\nYou say: Find good first issues in this repository and rank them by difficulty.\\nCopilot queries GitHub Issues with its built-in GitHub MCP server and suggests a curated list, complete with difficulty levels. Instead of scanning dozens of issues, you can dive straight into a task that matches your comfort zone.\\n5. Start implementing\\nNow comes the real work. Normally, after finding an issue to work on, you\u2019d create a branch, open the right files, make edits, and double-check your changes before committing. With Copilot CLI, you can let it draft the fix for you while you stay in control at every step.\\nYou say: Start implementing issue #1234. Show me the diff before applying.\\nCopilot drafts a plan, makes the edits, and presents the diff. You stay in control, review, and approve before changes are applied.\xa0\\n\ud83d\udc40 Pro tip: You can @-mention files in your prompt if you want Copilot to focus on specific parts of the code.\\n6. Commit and open a draft pull request\xa0\\nOnce the changes look good, the next step is packaging them up and sharing your work. Normally, that means staging files, writing a commit message, pushing a branch, and opening a pull request, which is all a bit of a dance in Git. Copilot CLI streamlines the whole flow so you can stay focused on the code.\\nYou say: Stage changes, write a commit referencing #1234, and open a draft PR.\\nCopilot will then stage files, write the commit message, and open a draft pull request for you to review.\xa0\\n7. Bonus: Kill that process hogging your port\\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve hit another common headache: a process hogging a port. You know, that moment when you try to start your dev server and it tells you a port (let\u2019s say 8080 for this example) is already in use, and you have to go hunting for the right lsof command and flags.\\nYou say: What process is using port 8080? Kill it and verify the port is free.\\nCopilot runs the right lsof command, shows the PID, kills the process, and verifies it\u2019s gone. No more Googling arcane flags or trying to remember if it\u2019s lsof -i :8080 or lsof -t -i:8080 or something else entirely.\\nI\u2019m horrible at remembering commands, especially ones I use infrequently. With Copilot CLI, I just defer these tasks straight to it. Maybe I\u2019ll remember the command next time, or maybe (probably) not. But I\u2019ll definitely ask Copilot again.\\nStay in control\\nCopilot always asks before running commands or accessing directories. This is critical when you\u2019re giving an AI access to run things on your machine.\\nBefore Copilot can execute anything, it will prompt you to:\\nAllow once\\nAllow always for this command\\nDeny\\nYou can also:\\nUse /session to view what\u2019s currently allowed\\nReset permissions at any time with /reset\\nAdd directories to your allowed list with /add-directory\\nExtend with MCP servers\\nCopilot CLI ships with the GitHub MCP server already installed and running. This is what powers the issue search and repository interactions. But you can add any MCP server you want from the registry using /mcp.\\nWant to add Playwright for browser testing? Or integrate with your company\u2019s internal tools? You can customize and extend Copilot CLI to match your workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy this matters\\nHere\u2019s what I appreciate most about Copilot CLI: It meets me where I already work. I spend a lot of time in the terminal anyway, jumping between repositories, checking logs, running builds. Having Copilot right there means I\u2019m not constantly switching contexts between my IDE, browser, and command line just to get AI help.\\nWhen I\u2019m onboarding contributors to our projects or exploring a new codebase myself, I can stay in that flow. I can ask about the project structure, verify dependencies, find issues to work on, and start implementing without bouncing around between tools. That consistency matters when you\u2019re trying to maintain momentum.\\nThis isn\u2019t about replacing your IDE. It\u2019s about having the right tool in the right place.\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next\\nCopilot CLI is in public preview, and your feedback will shape our roadmap. We have ideas for what\u2019s coming next, but we want to know what matters most to you.\\n\ud83d\udc49 Install it today with:\\nnpm install -g copilot\\nThen share your experience using /feedback.\\nStart using GitHub Copilot CLI >\\n\\nThe post GitHub Copilot CLI: How to get started appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"Andrea Griffiths","description":"<p>Discover how to use GitHub Copilot directly in the terminal.

But here&rsquo;s what you need to know: The clearer, more precise, more context-rich your prompt, the better, more accurate your outcome. This is where Markdown comes in. With Markdown&rsquo;s structure (its headers, lists, and links), you can naturally guide AI&rsquo;s reasoning, making outputs more predictable and consistent.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To provide a strong foundation for your prompt engineering, try these techniques with Markdown as your guide:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Context loading</strong>: <code>[Review existing patterns](./src/patterns/)</code>.

Every time you iterate, you make your agent a little more reliable and consistent.

This helps them preserve valuable context window space and improve their reliability and effectiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here are some techniques to make sure they get the right context&mdash;this is called context engineering:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Session splitting</strong>: Use distinct agent sessions for different development phases and tasks. For example, use one session for planning, one for implementation, and one for testing. If an agent has fresh context, it&rsquo;ll have better focus.

Perhaps you started the same way: You opened GitHub Copilot, started asking questions in natural language, and hoped for a usable output. This approach can work for simple fixes and code suggestions, but as your needs get more complex\u2014or as your work gets more collaborative\u2014you\u2019re going to need a more foolproof strategy.\xa0\\nThis guide will introduce you to a three-part framework that transforms this ad-hoc style of AI experimentation into a repeatable and reliable engineering practice. At its core are two concepts: agentic primitives, which are reusable, configurable building blocks that enable AI agents to work systematically; and context engineering, which ensures your AI agents always focus on the right information. By familiarizing yourself with these concepts, you\u2019ll be able to build AI systems that can not only code independently, but do so reliably, predictably, and consistently.\\nThe AI-native development framework\\nMarkdown prompt engineering + agent primitives + context engineering = reliability\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re new to AI-native development or looking to bring deeper reliability to your agent workflows, this guide will give you the foundation you need to build, scale, and share intelligent systems that learn and improve with every use.\\n\ud83e\udde0 Try it yourself: Build and run agentic workflows with GitHub Copilot CLI\\nBring your agent primitives to life right from your terminal. The new GitHub Copilot CLI lets you run, debug, and automate AI workflows locally\u2014no setup scripts, no context loss. It connects directly to your repositories, pull requests, and issues through GitHub MCP, giving your agents the same context they\u2019d have in your IDE.\xa0\\n\ud83d\udc49 Get started with GitHub Copilot CLI >\\nWhat are agent primitives?\xa0\\nThe three-layer framework below turns ad-hoc AI experimentation into a reliable, repeatable process. It does this by combining the structure of Markdown; the power of agent primitives, simple building blocks that give your AI agents clear instructions and capabilities; and smart context management, so your agents always get the right information (not just more information).\xa0\\nLayer 1: Use Markdown for more strategic prompt engineering\\nWe\u2019ve written about the importance of prompt engineering. But here\u2019s what you need to know: The clearer, more precise, more context-rich your prompt, the better, more accurate your outcome. This is where Markdown comes in. With Markdown\u2019s structure (its headers, lists, and links), you can naturally guide AI\u2019s reasoning, making outputs more predictable and consistent.\xa0\\nTo provide a strong foundation for your prompt engineering, try these techniques with Markdown as your guide:\xa0\\nContext loading: [Review existing patterns](./src/patterns/). In this case, links become context injection points that pull in relevant information, either from files or websites.\\nStructured thinking: Use headers and bullets to create clear reasoning pathways for the AI to follow.\\nRole activation: Use phrases like \u201cYou are an expert [in this role].\u201d This triggers specialized knowledge domains and will focus the AI\u2019s responses.\\nTool integration: Use MCP tool tool-name. This lets your AI agent run code in a controlled, repeatable, and predictable way on MCP servers.\\nPrecise language: Eliminate ambiguity through specific instructions.\\nValidation gates: \u201cStop and get user approval.\u201d Make sure there is always human oversight at critical decision points.\\nFor example, instead of saying, Find and fix the bug, use the following:\\nYou are an expert debugger, specialized in debugging complex programming issues.\\n\\nYou are particularly great at debugging this project, which architecture and quirks can be consulted in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture.md). \\n\\nFollow these steps:\\n\\n1. Review the [error logs](./logs/error.log) and identify the root cause. \\n\\n2. Use the `azmcp-monitor-log-query` MCP tool to retrieve infrastructure logs from Azure.  \\n\\n3. Once you find the root cause, think about 3 potential solutions with trade-offs\\n\\n4. Present your root cause analysis and suggested solutions with trade-offs to the user and seek validation before proceeding with fixes - do not change any files.\\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable with structured prompting, you\u2019ll quickly realize that manually crafting perfect prompts for every task is unsustainable. (Who has the time?) This is where the second step comes in: turning your prompt engineering insights into reusable, configurable systems.\\nLayer 2: Agentic primitives: Deploying your new prompt engineering techniques\\nNow it\u2019s time to implement all of your new strategies more systematically, instead of prompting ad hoc. These configurable tools will help you do just that.\\nCore agent primitives\\nWhen it comes to AI-native development, a core agent primitive refers to a simple, reusable file or module that provides a specific capability or rule for an agent.\xa0\\nHere are some examples:\\nInstructions files: Deploy structured guidance through modular .instructions.md files with targeted scope. At GitHub, we offer custom instructions to give Copilot repository-specific guidance and preferences.\xa0\\nChat modes: Deploy role-based expertise through .chatmode.md files with MCP tool boundaries that prevent security breaches and cross-domain interference. For example, professional licenses that keep architects from building and engineers from planning.\\nAgentic workflows: Deploy reusable prompts through .prompt.md files with built-in validation.\\nSpecification files: Create implementation-ready blueprints through .spec.md files that ensure repeatable results, whether the work is done by a person or by AI.\\nAgent memory files: Preserve knowledge across sessions through .memory.md files.\\nContext helper files: Optimize information retrieval through .context.md files.\\nHow using a core agent primitive can transform a prompt and its outcome\\nTechnique: Using Markdown prompt engineering, your prompt can be: \u201cImplement secure user authentication system\u201d\xa0\\nPrimitives: You\u2019ll select backend-dev chat mode \u2192 Auto-triggers security.instructions.md via applyTo: \\"auth/**\\" \u2192 Loads context from [Previous auth patterns](.memory.md#security) and [API Security Standards](api-security.context.md#rest) \u2192 Generates user-auth.spec.md using structured templates \u2192 Executes implement-from-spec.prompt.md workflow with validation gates.\\nOutcome: Developer-driven knowledge accumulation where you capture implementation failures in .memory.md, document successful patterns in .instructions.md, and refine workflows in .prompt.md files\u2014creating compound intelligence that improves through your iterative refinement.\\nThis transformation might seem complex, but notice the pattern: What started as an ad-hoc request became a systematic workflow with clear handoff points, automatic context loading, and built-in validation.\xa0\\nWhen you use these files and modules, you can keep adjusting and improving how your AI agent works at every step. Every time you iterate, you make your agent a little more reliable and consistent. And this isn\u2019t just random trial and error \u2014 you\u2019re following a structured, repeatable approach that helps you get better and more predictable results every time you use the AI.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Native VS Code support: While VS Code natively supports .instructions.md, .prompt.md, and .chatmode.md files, this framework takes things further with .spec.md, .memory.md, and .context.md patterns that unlock even more exciting possibilities AI-powered software development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith your prompts structured and your agentic primitives set up, you may encounter a new challenge: Even the best prompts and primitives can fail when they\u2019re faced with irrelevant context or they\u2019re competing for limited AI attention. The third layer, which we\u2019ll get to next, addresses this through strategic context management.\\nLayer 3: Context engineering: Helping your AI agents focus on what matters\\nJust like people, LLMs have finite limited memory (context windows), and can sometimes be forgetful. If you can be strategic about the context you give them, you can help them focus on what\u2019s relevant and enable them to get started and work quicker. This helps them preserve valuable context window space and improve their reliability and effectiveness.\\nHere are some techniques to make sure they get the right context\u2014this is called context engineering:\xa0\\nSession splitting: Use distinct agent sessions for different development phases and tasks. For example, use one session for planning, one for implementation, and one for testing. If an agent has fresh context, it\u2019ll have better focus. It\u2019s always better to have a fresh context window for complex tasks.\xa0\\nModular and custom rules and instructions: Apply only relevant instructions through targeted .instructions.md files using applyTo YAML frontmatter syntax. This preserves context space for actual work and reduces irrelevant suggestions.\xa0\\nMemory-driven development: Leverage agent memory through .memory.md files to maintain project knowledge and decisions across sessions and time.\\nContext optimization: Use .context.md context helper files strategically to accelerate information retrieval and reduce cognitive load.\xa0\\nCognitive focus optimization: Use chat modes in .chatmode.md files to keep the AI\u2019s attention on relevant domains and prevent cross-domain interference. Less context pollution means you\u2019ll have more consistent and accurate outputs.\xa0\\nAgentic workflows: The complete system in action\\nNow that you understand all three layers, you can see how they combine into agentic workflows\u2014complete, systematic processes where all of your agentic primitives are working together, understanding your prompts, and using only the context they need.\xa0\xa0\\nThese agentic workflows can be implemented as .prompt.md files that coordinate multiple agentic primitives into processes, designed to work whether executed locally in your IDE, in your terminal or in your CI pipelines.\\nNeed a recap?\xa0\\nMarkdown prompt engineering provides the structural foundation for predictable AI interactions.\\nAgent primitives are your configurable tools that scale and systematize these techniques.\\nContext engineering optimizes AI cognitive performance within memory constraints.\\nAgentic workflows in Markdown apply prompt and context engineering that leverages agent primitives to implement complete, reliable agentic processes.\\nThis framework creates compound intelligence that improves as you continue to iterate.\\nTooling: how to scale agent primitives\\nNow that you understand the three-layer framework and that the agentic primitives are essentially executable software written in natural language, the question is: How can you scale these Markdown files beyond your individual development workflow?\\nNatural language as code\\nThe answer mirrors every programming ecosystem\u2019s evolution. Just like JavaScript evolved from browser scripts to using Node.js runtimes, package managers, and deployment tooling, agent primitives need similar infrastructure to reach their full potential.\\nThis isn\u2019t just a metaphor: These .prompt.md and .instructions.md files represent a genuine new form of software development that requires proper tooling infrastructure.\\nHere\u2019s what we mean: Think of your agent primitives as real pieces of software, just written in natural language instead of code. They have all the same qualities: You can break complex tasks into smaller pieces (modularity), use the same instructions in multiple places (reusability), rely on other tools or files (dependencies), keep improving and updating them (evolution), and share them across teams (distribution).\\nThat said, your natural language programs are going to need the same infrastructure support as any other software.\xa0\xa0\\nAgent CLI runtimes\\nMost developers start by creating and running agent primitives directly in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, which is ideal for interactive development, debugging, and refining daily workflows. However, when you want to move beyond the editor\u2014to automate your workflows, schedule them, or integrate them into larger systems\u2014you need agent CLI runtimes like Copilot CLI.\xa0\\nThese runtimes let you execute your agent primitives from the command line and tap into advanced model capabilities. This shift unlocks automation, scaling, and seamless integration into production environments, taking your natural language programs from personal tools to powerful, shareable solutions.\xa0\\nInner loop vs. outer loop\\nInner loop (VS Code and GitHub Copilot): Interactive development, testing, and workflow refinement\\nOuter loop (agent CLI runtimes): Reproducible execution, CI/CD integration, and production deployment\\nAgent CLI Runtimes transform your agent primitives from IDE-bound files into independently executable workflows that run consistently across any environment. They provide command-line execution, CI/CD integration, environment consistency, and native support for MCP servers, which bridge your development work to production reality.\\nTL;DR: Use the inner loop for rapid, interactive work and the outer loop for reliable, repeatable automation and deployment.\\nRuntime management\\nWhile VS Code and GitHub Copilot handle individual development, some teams may want additional infrastructure for sharing, versioning, and productizing their agent primitives. Managing multiple Agent CLI runtimes can become complex quickly, with different installation procedures, configuration requirements, and compatibility matrices.\\nAPM (Agent Package Manager) solves this by providing unified runtime management and package distribution. Instead of manually installing and configuring each vendor CLI, APM handles the complexity while preserving your existing VS Code workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s how runtime management works in practice:\\n# Install APM once\\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmeppiel/apm/main/install.sh | sh\\n\\n# Optional: setup your GitHub PAT to use GitHub Copilot CLI\\nexport GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT=your_token_here\\n\\n# APM manages runtime installation for you\\napm runtime setup copilot          # Installs GitHub Copilot CLI\\napm runtime setup codex            # Installs OpenAI Codex CLI\\n\\n# Install MCP dependencies (like npm install)\\napm install\\n\\n# Compile Agent Primitive files to Agents.md files\\napm compile\\n\\n# Run workflows against your chosen runtime\\n# This will trigger \'copilot -p security-review.prompt.md\' command \\n# Check the example apm.yml file a bit below in this guide\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\\nAs you can see, your daily development stays exactly the same in VS Code, APM installs and configures runtimes automatically, your workflows run regardless of which runtime is installed, and the same apm run command works consistently across all runtimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDistribution and packaging\\nAgent primitives\u2019 similarities to traditional software become most apparent when you get to the point of wanting to share them with your team or deploying them into production\u2014when you start to require things like package management, dependency resolution, version control, and distribution mechanisms.\\nHere\u2019s the challenge: You\u2019ve built powerful agent primitives in VS Code and your team wants to use them, but distributing Markdown files and ensuring consistent MCP dependencies across different environments becomes unwieldy. You need the equivalent of npm for natural language programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM provides this missing layer. It doesn\u2019t replace your VS Code workflow\u2014it extends it by creating distributable packages of agent primitives complete with dependencies, configuration, and runtime compatibility that teams can share, just like npm packages.\\nPackage management in practice\\n# Initialize new APM project (like npm init)\\napm init security-review-workflow\\n\\n# Develop and test your workflow locally\\ncd security-review-workflow \\napm compile && apm install\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\\n\\n# Package for distribution (future: apm publish)\\n# Share apm.yml and Agent Primitive files with team\\n# Team members can install and use your primitives\\ngit clone your-workflow-repo\\ncd your-workflow-repo && apm compile && apm install\\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=456\\nThe benefits compound quickly: You can distribute tested workflows as versioned packages with dependencies, automatically resolve and install required MCP servers, track workflow evolution and maintain compatibility across updates, build on (and contribute to) shared libraries from the community, and ensure everyone\u2019s running the same thing.\\nProject configuration\\nThe following\xa0 apm.yml configuration file serves as the package.json equivalent for agent primitives, defining scripts, dependencies, and input parameters:\\n# apm.yml - Project configuration (like package.json)\\nname: security-review-workflow\\nversion: 1.2.0\\ndescription: Comprehensive security review process with GitHub integration\\n\\nscripts:\\n  copilot-sec-review: \\"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  codex-sec-review: \\"codex security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  copilot-debug: \\"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\\"\\n  \\ndependencies:\\n  mcp:\\n    - ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\\nWith this, your agent primitives can now be packaged as distributable software with managed dependencies.\\nProduction deployment\\nThe final piece of the tooling ecosystem enables continuous AI: packaged agent primitives can now run automatically in the same CI/CD pipelines you use every day, bringing your carefully developed workflows into your production environment.\\nUsing APM GitHub Action, and building on the security-review-workflow package example above, here\u2019s how the same APM project deploys to production with multi-runtime flexibility:\\n# .github/workflows/security-review.yml\\nname: AI Security Review Pipeline\\non: \\n  pull_request:\\n    types: [opened, synchronize]\\n\\njobs:\\n  security-analysis:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    strategy:\\n      matrix:\\n        # Maps to apm.yml scripts\\n        script: [copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug]  \\n    permissions:\\n      models: read\\n      pull-requests: write\\n      contents: read\\n    \\n    steps:\\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\\n    \\n    - name: Run Security Review (${{ matrix.script }})\\n      uses: danielmeppiel/action-apm-cli@v1\\n      with:\\n        script: ${{ matrix.script }}\\n        parameters: |\\n          {\\n            \\"pr_id\\": \\"${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\\"\\n          }\\n      env:\\n        GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT: ${{ secrets.COPILOT_CLI_PAT }}\\nKey connection: The matrix.script values (copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug) correspond exactly to the scripts defined in the apm.yml configuration above. APM automatically installs the MCP dependencies (ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server) and passes the input parameters (pr_id) to your security-review.prompt.md workflow.\\nHere\u2019s why this matters:\xa0\\nAutomation: Your AI workflows now run on their own, without anyone needing to manually trigger them.\\nReliability: They run with the same consistency and reproducibility as traditional code deployments.\\nFlexibility: You can run different versions or types of analysis (mapped to different scripts) as needed.\\nIntegration: These workflows become part of your organization\u2019s standard CI/CD pipelines, just like regular software quality checks.\\nThis setup ultimately means your agent primitives are no longer just local experiments\u2014they are fully automated tools that you can rely on as part of your software delivery process, running in CI/CD whenever needed, with all dependencies and parameters managed for you.\\nEcosystem evolution\\nThis progression follows the same predictable pattern as every successful programming ecosystem. Understanding this pattern helps you see where AI-native development is heading and how to position your work strategically.\\nThe evolution happens in four stages:\\nRaw Code \u2192 agent primitives (.prompt.md, .instructions.md files)\\nRuntime environments \u2192 Agent CLI runtimes\xa0\\nPackage management \u2192 APM (distribution and orchestration layer)\\nThriving ecosystem \u2192 Shared libraries, tools, and community packages\\nJust as npm enabled JavaScript\u2019s explosive growth by solving the package distribution problem, APM enables the agent primitive ecosystem to flourish by providing the missing infrastructure layer that makes sharing and scaling natural language programs practical.\\nThe transformation is profound: what started as individual Markdown files in your editor becomes a systematic software development practice with proper tooling, distribution, and production deployment capabilities.\\nKey takeaways\\nAgent primitives are software: Your .prompt.md and .instructions.md files represent executable natural language programs that deserve professional tooling infrastructure.\\nRuntime diversity enables scale: Agent CLI runtimes provide the execution environments that bridge development to production.\\nPackage management is critical: APM provides the npm-equivalent layer that makes agent primitives truly portable and shareable.\\nProduction ready today: This tooling stack enables automated AI workflows in CI/CD pipelines with enterprise-grade reliability.\\nEcosystem growth pattern: Package management infrastructure creates the foundation for thriving ecosystems of shared workflows, tools, and community libraries.\\nHow to get started with building your first agent primitive\\nNow it\u2019s time to build your first agent primitives. Here\u2019s the plan:\xa0\\nStart with instructions: Write clear instructions that tell the AI exactly what you want it to do and how it should behave.\\nAdd chat modes: Set up special rules (chat modes) to create safe boundaries for the AI, making sure it interacts in the way you want and avoids unwanted behavior.\\nBuild reusable prompts: Create prompt templates for tasks you do often, so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch each time. These templates help the AI handle common jobs quickly and consistently.\\nCreate specification templates: Make templates that help you plan out what you want your AI to accomplish, then turn those plans into actionable steps the AI can follow.\\nInstructions architecture\\nInstructions form the bedrock of reliable AI behavior: They\u2019re the rules that guide the agent without cluttering your immediate context. Rather than repeating the same guidance in every conversation, instructions embed your team\u2019s knowledge directly into the AI\u2019s reasoning process.\\nThe key insight is modularity: instead of one massive instruction file that applies everywhere, you can create targeted files that activate only when working with specific technologies or file types. This context engineering approach keeps your AI focused and your guidance relevant.\\n\u2705 Quick actions:\\nCreate the general copilot-instructions.md file in the .github folder for the repository with common rules.\\nCreate modular .instructions.md files in the .github/instructions/ folder by domain (frontend, backend, testing, docs, specs\u2026).\\nUse applyTo: \\"**/*.{js,ts...}\\" patterns for selective application.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 copilot-instructions.md          # Global repository rules\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 instructions/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend.instructions.md     # applyTo: \\"**/*.{jsx,tsx,css}\\"\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend.instructions.md      # applyTo: \\"**/*.{py,go,java}\\"\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 testing.instructions.md      # applyTo: \\"**/test/**\\"\\nExample: Markdown prompt engineering in Instructions with frontend.instructions.md:\\n---\\napplyTo: \\"**/*.{ts,tsx}\\"\\ndescription: \\"TypeScript development guidelines with context engineering\\"\\n---\\n# TypeScript Development Guidelines\\n\\n\\n## Context Loading\\nReview [project conventions](../docs/conventions.md) and \\n[type definitions](../types/index.ts) before starting.\\n\\n\\n## Deterministic Requirements\\n- Use strict TypeScript configuration\\n- Implement error boundaries for React components\\n- Apply ESLint TypeScript rules consistently\\n\\n\\n## Structured Output\\nGenerate code with:\\n- [ ] JSDoc comments for all public APIs\\n- [ ] Unit tests in `__tests__/` directory\\n- [ ] Type exports in appropriate index files\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Checkpoint: Instructions are context-efficient and non-conflicting.\\nChat modes configuration\\nWith your instruction architecture in place, you still need a way to enforce domain boundaries and prevent AI agents from overstepping their expertise. Chat modes solve this by creating professional boundaries similar to real-world licensing. For example, you\u2019d want your architect to plan a bridge and not build it themself.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s how to set those boundaries:\xa0\\nDefine domain-specific custom chat modes with MCP tool boundaries.\\nEncapsulate tech stack knowledge and guidelines per mode.\\nDefine the most appropriate LLM model for your chat mode.\\nConfigure secure MCP tool access to prevent cross-domain security breaches.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Security through MCP tool boundaries: Each chat mode receives only the specific MCP tools needed for their domain. Giving each chat mode only the tools it needs keeps your AI workflows safe, organized, and professionally separated\u2014just like real-world roles and permissions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 chatmodes/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 architect.chatmode.md             # Planning specialist - designs, cannot execute\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend-engineer.chatmode.md     # UI specialist - builds interfaces, no backend access\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend-engineer.chatmode.md      # API specialist - builds services, no UI modification\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 technical-writer.chatmode.md      # Documentation specialist - writes docs, cannot run code\\nExample: Creating MCP tool boundaries with backend-engineer.chatmode.md:\\n---\\ndescription: \'Backend development specialist with security focus\'\\ntools: [\'changes\', \'codebase\', \'editFiles\', \'runCommands\', \'runTasks\', \\n        \'search\', \'problems\', \'testFailure\', \'terminalLastCommand\']\\nmodel: Claude Sonnet 4\\n---\\nYou are a backend development specialist focused on secure API development, database design, and server-side architecture.

These can be executed locally or delegated to independent agents. Here\u2019s how to get started:\xa0\\nCreate .prompt.md files for complete development processes.\\nBuild in mandatory human reviews.\\nDesign workflows for both local execution and independent delegation.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\\n.github/prompts/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 code-review.prompt.md           # With validation checkpoints\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 feature-spec.prompt.md          # Spec-first methodology\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 async-implementation.prompt.md  # GitHub Coding Agent delegation\\nExample: Complete agentic workflow with feature-spec.prompt.md:\\n---\\nmode: agent\\nmodel: gpt-4\\ntools: [\'file-search\', \'semantic-search\', \'github\']\\ndescription: \'Feature implementation workflow with validation gates\'\\n---\\n# Feature Implementation from Specification\\n\\n\\n## Context Loading Phase\\n1.

Without a clear, consistent way to document requirements, things can get lost in translation, leading to mistakes, misunderstandings, or missed steps. This is where specification templates come in. These templates ensure that both people and AI agents can take a concept (like a new feature or API) and reliably implement it.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s what these templates help you accomplish:\xa0\\nStandardize the process: You create a new specification for each feature, API endpoint, or component.\\nProvide blueprints for implementation: These specs include everything a developer (or an AI agent) needs to know to start building: the problem, the approach, required components, validation criteria, and a checklist for handoff.\\nMake handoff deterministic: By following a standard, the transition from planning to doing is clear and predictable.\\n\ud83d\udd27 Tools and files:\xa0\\nSpec-kit is a neat tool that fully implements a specification-driven approach to agentic coding. It allows you to easily get started with creating specs (spec.md), an implementation plan (plan.md) and splitting that into actual tasks (tasks.md) ready for developers or coding agents to work on.\\n\u26a0\ufe0f \ufe0fCheckpoint: Specifications are split into tasks that are implementation-ready before delegation.\\nReady to go? Here\u2019s a quickstart checklist\\nYou now have a complete foundation for systematic AI development. The checklist below walks through the implementation sequence, building toward creating complete agentic workflows.\\nConceptual foundation\\nUnderstand Markdown prompt engineering principles (semantic structure, precision, and tools).\\nGrasp context engineering fundamentals (context window optimization and session strategy).\\nImplementation steps\\nCreate .github/copilot-instructions.md with basic project guidelines (context engineering: global rules).\\nSet up domain-specific .instructions.md files with applyTo patterns (context engineering: selective loading).\\nConfigure chat modes for your tech stack domains (context engineering: domain boundaries).\\nCreate your first .prompt.md agentic workflow.\\nBuild your first .spec.md template for feature specifications (you can use spec-kit for this).\\nPractice a spec-driven approach with session splitting: plan first, split into tasks, and lastly, implement.\\nTake this with you\\nWorking with AI agents shouldn\u2019t have to be unpredictable. With the right planning and tools, these agents can quickly become a reliable part of your workflow and processes\u2014boosting not only your own productivity, but your team\u2019s too.\xa0\\nReady for the next phase of multi-agent coordination delegation?

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch.

Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic.

Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks.

The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from companies victimized by data theft.\\nU.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo \u2014 U.K. resident Thalha Jubair \u2014\xa0who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against Marks & Spencer and Harrods, the British food retailer Co-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions at MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.\\n\\nA Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Teenagers.\u201d\\n\\nIn August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida man Noah Michael Urban was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.\\nIn April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member was extradited from Spain to the U.S., where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allege\xa0Tyler Robert Buchanan\xa0and co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims.\\nUpdate, Oct. 8, 8:59 a.m. ET: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the malware sent by the reader as a Windows screenshot file. Rather, it is a Windows screensaver file.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/#comments","description":"A cybercriminal group that used voice phishing attacks to siphon more than a billion records from Salesforce customers earlier this year has launched a website that threatens to publish data stolen from dozens of Fortune 500 firms if they refuse to pay a ransom.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

The complaint alleges the group&#8217;s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.</p>\\n<p>U.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair&#8217;s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.</p>\\n<p>The complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.\\nAt a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled Transport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.\\n\\nA court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity reported that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider ransom attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group.\\nThat story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group\u2019s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.\\nThe story also noted that Jubair\u2019s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair\u2019s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.\\nEARLY DAYS (2021-2022)\\nJubair is alleged to have been a core member of the LAPSUS$\xa0cybercrime group that\xa0broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including\xa0Microsoft,\xa0Nvidia,\xa0Okta,\xa0Rockstar Games,\xa0Samsung,\xa0T-Mobile, and\xa0Uber.\\nThat is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames Amtrak\xa0and\xa0Asyntax. In the middle of the gang\u2019s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\\nThe leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax\u2019s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:\\n\\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair\u2019s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\\n\\n\\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including \u201cEverlynn,\u201d who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d\xa0targeting the major social media and email providers.\\nIn these so-called \u201cfake EDR\u201d schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\\n\\nThe roster of the now-defunct \u201cInfinity Recursion\u201d hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder \u201cEverlynn\u201d has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as \u201cPeter\u201d became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair\u2019s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$\u2019s chat channel.\\n\\n\\nEARTHTOSTAR\\nProsecutors in New Jersey last week alleged Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, 0ktapus, and UNC3944, and that he used the nicknames EarthtoStar, Brad, Austin, and Austistic.\\nBeginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called Star Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nJubair allegedly used the handle \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.\\n\\nThe group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target\u2019s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim\u2019s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.\\nIn February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with \u201cTmo up!\u201d and \u201cTmo down!\u201d notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile\u2019s network.\\n\\nA redacted receipt from Star Chat\u2019s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.\\n\\nThe data showed that Star Chat \u2014 along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time \u2014 collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.\\n\\nThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.\\n\\nA review of EarthtoStar\u2019s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint shows this person also sold \u201cAT&T email resets\u201d and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:\\n\u201cOk people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says \u20182fa required\u2019 or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?\u201d\\n\\nNew Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022 that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer\u2019s Okta authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.\\nThe phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.\\nThat weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, Plex and Signal.\\n\\nA visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.\\n\\nDA, COMRADE\\nEarthtoStar\u2019s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel \u201cFrauwudchat\u201d:\\n\u201cHi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API\u2019s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.\u201d\\n\\nAt around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat \u2014 \u201cRocketAce\u201d and \u201cLopiu\u201d \u2014 introduced the group\u2019s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit, including:\\n-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;\\n\\nThe user \u201cLopiu\u201d on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.\\n\\nThese two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar\u2019s many aliases, posted to Exploit:\\nHello. I have access to a telecommunications company\u2019s citrix and vpn. I would like someone to help me break out of the system and potentially attack the domain controller so all logins can be extracted we can discuss payment and things leave your telegram in the comments or private message me ! Looking for someone with knowledge in citrix/privilege escalation\\n\\nOn Nov. 15, 2022, EarthtoStar posted to their Star Sanctuary Telegram channel that they were hiring malware developers with a minimum of three years of experience and the ability to develop rootkits, backdoors and malware loaders.\\n\u201cOptional: Endorsed by advanced APT Groups (e.g. Conti, Ryuk),\u201d the ad concluded, referencing two of Russia\u2019s most rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate operations. \u201cPart of a nation-state / ex-3l (3 letter-agency).\u201d\\n2023-PRESENT DAY\\nThe Telegram and Discord chat channels wherein Flowers and Jubair allegedly planned and executed their extortion attacks are part of a loose-knit network known as the Com, an English-speaking cybercrime community consisting mostly of individuals living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\\nMany of these Com chat servers have hundreds to thousands of members each, and some of the more interesting solicitations on these communities are job offers for in-person assignments and tasks that can be found if one searches for posts titled, \u201cIf you live near,\u201d or \u201cIRL job\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cin real life\u201d job.\\nThese \u201cviolence-as-a-service\u201d solicitations typically involve \u201cbrickings,\u201d where someone is hired to toss a brick through the window at a specified address. Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it\u2019s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.\\nIt remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department\u2019s website, along with the message:\\n\u201cNeed irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either\u201d\\n\\nThroughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar\u2019s alias \u201cBrad\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cBrad_banned\u201d) frequently advertised Star Chat\u2019s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker\u2019s presence on a victim machine:\\nWe can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,\\nThis shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!\\nKernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.\\nBypass all major EDR\u2019s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)\\nOnce implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)\\nBe one step ahead of the game. Prices start from $5,000+. Message @brad_banned to get a quote\\n\\nIn September 2023 , both MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment suffered ransomware attacks at the hands of a Russian ransomware affiliate program known as ALPHV and BlackCat. Caesars reportedly paid a $15 million ransom in that incident.\\nWithin hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they\u2019d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.\\nThe Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.\\nIn April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of \u201cThe Com Cast,\u201d a lengthy screed detailing Jubair\u2019s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years. This account included photos and voice recordings allegedly of Jubair, and asserted that in his early days on the Com Jubair used the nicknames Clark and Miku (these are both aliases used by Everlynn in connection with their fake EDR services).\\n\\nThalha Jubair (right), without his large-rimmed glasses, in an undated photo posted in The Com Cast.\\n\\nMore recently, the anonymous Com Cast author(s) claimed, Jubair had used the nickname \u201cOperator,\u201d which corresponds to a Com member who ran an automated Telegram-based doxing service that pulled consumer records from hacked data broker accounts. That public outing came after Operator allegedly seized control over the Doxbin, a long-running and highly toxic community that is used to \u201cdox\u201d or post deeply personal information on people.\\n\u201cOperator/Clark/Miku: A key member of the ransomware group Scattered Spider, which consists of a diverse mix of individuals involved in SIM swapping and phishing,\u201d the Com Cast account stated. \u201cThe group is an amalgamation of several key organizations, including Infinity Recursion (owned by Operator), True Alcorians (owned by earth2star), and Lapsus, which have come together to form a single collective.\u201d\\nThe New Jersey complaint (PDF) alleges Jubair and other Scattered Spider members committed computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in relation to at least 120 computer network intrusions involving 47 U.S. entities between May 2022 and September 2025. The complaint alleges the group\u2019s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.\\nU.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair\u2019s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.\\nThe complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida man charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.\\nUrban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.\\n\\nNoah \u201cKingbob\u201d Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.\\n\\nA\xa0court transcript (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban\u2019s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.\\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B, and easily one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.\\nIn the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing \u2014 and very often bragging about \u2014 serious cybercrime offenses.\\n\u201cHere we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cMost get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d\\nNixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they\u2019re released.\\nIndeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.\\n\u201cWhat we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.\u201d\\nNixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.\\n\u201cIf law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,\u201d she said.\\nThe Times of London reports that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.\\nJubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.\\nIn the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features.

In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident.

He <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXMeRaiq9t/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">said</a> in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Duarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXSL3jClWD/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">available</a> open sources documenting this strike.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"915\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49774\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg 1080w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-300x254.jpg 300w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-768x651.jpg 768w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Burned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

(Credit: Mauricioro Morales/Al Jazeera; Airman 1st Class Brooke Moeder/DVIDS; Israel Police)\\nBellingcat showed the images and footage to munitions expert Dr N.R. Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red. (Credit: Mauricio Morales/Al Jazeera; Israel Police; Facebook/\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0621)\\nDr Jenzen-Jones further stated: \u201cThe fuze features an external clip for the safety-pin ring-pull, as well as peripheral protection for the split pin. These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions. For example, the Ukraine-Russia war has led to many videos of drones with attached thermite or other incendiary munitions burning as they fly over enemy positions. Similar incendiary munitions have also been used in Gaza. All these burn in a manner consistent with the incendiary munitions used in the attacks on the Family Boat and Alma.\\n\\nScreencaptures from attacks on the Family Boat, Alma and incendiary munition attacks in Gaza.
