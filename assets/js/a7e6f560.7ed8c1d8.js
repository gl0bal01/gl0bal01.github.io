Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic.

Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks.

The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from companies victimized by data theft.\\nU.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo \u2014 U.K. resident Thalha Jubair \u2014\xa0who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against Marks & Spencer and Harrods, the British food retailer Co-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions at MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.\\n\\nA Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Teenagers.\u201d\\n\\nIn August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida man Noah Michael Urban was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.\\nIn April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member was extradited from Spain to the U.S., where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allege\xa0Tyler Robert Buchanan\xa0and co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims.\\nUpdate, Oct. 8, 8:59 a.m. ET: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the malware sent by the reader as a Windows screenshot file. Rather, it is a Windows screensaver file.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/#comments","description":"A cybercriminal group that used voice phishing attacks to siphon more than a billion records from Salesforce customers earlier this year has launched a website that threatens to publish data stolen from dozens of Fortune 500 firms if they refuse to pay a ransom.

Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.</p>\\n<p>In the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing &#8212; and very often bragging about &#8212; serious cybercrime offenses.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Here we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;Most get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they&#8217;re released.</p>\\n<p>Indeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;What we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;The members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Nixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;If law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,&#8221; she said.</p>\\n<p><em>The Times of London</em> <a href=\\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/teenagers-charged-tfl-cyberattack-scattered-spider-trdhs5rwf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">reports</a> that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.\\nAt a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled Transport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.\\n\\nA court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity reported that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider ransom attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group.\\nThat story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group\u2019s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.\\nThe story also noted that Jubair\u2019s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair\u2019s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.\\nEARLY DAYS (2021-2022)\\nJubair is alleged to have been a core member of the LAPSUS$\xa0cybercrime group that\xa0broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including\xa0Microsoft,\xa0Nvidia,\xa0Okta,\xa0Rockstar Games,\xa0Samsung,\xa0T-Mobile, and\xa0Uber.\\nThat is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames Amtrak\xa0and\xa0Asyntax. In the middle of the gang\u2019s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\\nThe leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax\u2019s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:\\n\\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair\u2019s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\\n\\n\\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including \u201cEverlynn,\u201d who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d\xa0targeting the major social media and email providers.\\nIn these so-called \u201cfake EDR\u201d schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\\n\\nThe roster of the now-defunct \u201cInfinity Recursion\u201d hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder \u201cEverlynn\u201d has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as \u201cPeter\u201d became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair\u2019s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$\u2019s chat channel.\\n\\n\\nEARTHTOSTAR\\nProsecutors in New Jersey last week alleged Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, 0ktapus, and UNC3944, and that he used the nicknames EarthtoStar, Brad, Austin, and Austistic.\\nBeginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called Star Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nJubair allegedly used the handle \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.\\n\\nThe group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target\u2019s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim\u2019s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.\\nIn February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with \u201cTmo up!\u201d and \u201cTmo down!\u201d notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile\u2019s network.\\n\\nA redacted receipt from Star Chat\u2019s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.\\n\\nThe data showed that Star Chat \u2014 along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time \u2014 collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.\\n\\nThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.\\n\\nA review of EarthtoStar\u2019s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint shows this person also sold \u201cAT&T email resets\u201d and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:\\n\u201cOk people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says \u20182fa required\u2019 or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?\u201d\\n\\nNew Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022 that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer\u2019s Okta authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.\\nThe phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.\\nThat weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, Plex and Signal.\\n\\nA visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.\\n\\nDA, COMRADE\\nEarthtoStar\u2019s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel \u201cFrauwudchat\u201d:\\n\u201cHi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API\u2019s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.\u201d\\n\\nAt around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat \u2014 \u201cRocketAce\u201d and \u201cLopiu\u201d \u2014 introduced the group\u2019s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit, including:\\n-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;\\n\\nThe user \u201cLopiu\u201d on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.\\n\\nThese two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar\u2019s many aliases, posted to Exploit:\\nHello. I have access to a telecommunications company\u2019s citrix and vpn.

Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair\u2019s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.\\nThe complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida man charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.\\nUrban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.\\n\\nNoah \u201cKingbob\u201d Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.\\n\\nA\xa0court transcript (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban\u2019s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.\\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B, and easily one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.\\nIn the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing \u2014 and very often bragging about \u2014 serious cybercrime offenses.\\n\u201cHere we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cMost get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d\\nNixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they\u2019re released.\\nIndeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.\\n\u201cWhat we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.\u201d\\nNixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.\\n\u201cIf law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,\u201d she said.\\nThe Times of London reports that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.\\nJubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.\\nIn the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. If extradited to the U.S., tried and convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison.\\nIn July 2025, the United Kingdom barred victims of hacking from paying ransoms to cybercriminal groups unless approved by officials. U.K. organizations that are considered part of critical infrastructure reportedly will face a complete ban, as will the entire public sector. U.K. victims of a hack are now required to notify officials to better inform policymakers on the scale of Britain\u2019s ransomware problem.\\nFor further reading (bless you), check out Bloomberg\u2019s poignant story last week based on a year\u2019s worth of jailhouse interviews with convicted Scattered Spider member Noah Urban.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/feds-tie-scattered-spider-duo-to-115m-in-ransoms/#comments","description":"U.S. prosecutors last week levied criminal hacking charges against 19-year-old U.K. national Thalha Jubair for allegedly being a core member of Scattered Spider, a prolific cybercrime group blamed for extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from victims.

It\u2019s designed to feel urgent and personal so you tap before you think. The whole funnel is built for phones: big tap targets, short copy, sticky chat bubbles\u2014perfect for someone arriving straight from TikTok.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks to our community for spotting this one. This exact scam was shared on our Malwarebytes subreddit by user Ok-Internal-2110, who posted a warning for TikTok users after encountering it firsthand.\\nI walked through the flow so you don\u2019t have to.\\nWhat the site shows vs. what actually exists\\nThe illusion:\\nThe moment you log in with the credentials from that TikTok DM, a glossy, mobile-friendly dashboard flashes a huge balance. There\u2019s motion (numbers \u201cupdate\u201d), a believable \u201chistory,\u201d and a big Withdraw button right where your thumb expects it. On a small screen, it looks like a real account with real money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trap:\\nWhen you try to send that balance to your own wallet, the site asks for a withdrawal key belonging to the original account holder\u2014the one from the DM. You don\u2019t have that key, and support won\u2019t give it to you. External withdrawals are a dead end by design.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe detour they push you to take:\\nSupport suggests using Internal Transfer instead. Conveniently, they also offer to help you create a new user \u201cin seconds,\u201d and this new account will have its own key (because you created it). That makes it feel like you\u2019re finally doing something legitimate: \u201cI\u2019ll just transfer the funds to my new account and then withdraw.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paywall you only meet once you\u2019re invested:\\nInternal transfers only work on \u201cVIP\u201d accounts. To upgrade to VIP, you must pay for a membership. Many victims pay here, assuming it\u2019s a one-time hurdle before they can finally withdraw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy nothing real ever leaves the site:\\nAfter you upgrade and attempt the internal transfer, the site can:\\ndemand another fee (a \u201climit lift,\u201d \u201ctax,\u201d or \u201csecurity key\u201d),\\nfail silently and push you to support, or\\n\u201ccomplete\u201d the transfer inside the fake ledger while still blocking any external withdrawal.\\nVictims end up paying for the privilege of moving fake numbers between fake accounts\u2014then paying again to \u201cunlock\u201d a withdrawal that never happens.\\nThe scam in a nutshell\\nThis scam is built for volume.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

(Credit: Mauricioro Morales/Al Jazeera; Airman 1st Class Brooke Moeder/DVIDS; Israel Police)\\nBellingcat showed the images and footage to munitions expert Dr N.R. Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions. For example, the Ukraine-Russia war has led to many videos of drones with attached thermite or other incendiary munitions burning as they fly over enemy positions. Similar incendiary munitions have also been used in Gaza. All these burn in a manner consistent with the incendiary munitions used in the attacks on the Family Boat and Alma.\\n\\nScreencaptures from attacks on the Family Boat, Alma and incendiary munition attacks in Gaza.

This parallel release strategy reflects the company\u2019s bet on multiple technological approaches rather than a single architectural paradigm.\\nDiffusion language models represent a departure from the autoregressive systems that underpin widely used chatbots like ChatGPT. Unlike sequential text generation, diffusion models produce outputs in parallel\u2014an approach already prevalent in image and video generation tools but less common in language processing.\\nAnt Group\u2019s performance metrics for dInfer suggest substantial efficiency gains. Testing on the company\u2019s LLaDA-MoE diffusion model yielded 1,011 tokens per second on the HumanEval coding benchmark, versus 91 tokens per second for Nvidia\u2019s Fast-dLLM framework and 294 for Alibaba\u2019s Qwen-2.5-3B model running on vLLM infrastructure.\\n\u201cWe believe that dInfer provides both a practical toolkit and a standardised platform to accelerate research and development in the rapidly growing field of dLLMs,\u201d researchers at Ant Group noted in accompanying technical documentation.\\nEcosystem expansion beyond language models\\nThe Ling-1T trillion-parameter AI model sits within a broader family of AI systems that Ant Group has assembled over recent months.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company\u2019s portfolio now spans three primary series: the Ling non-thinking models for standard language tasks, Ring thinking models designed for complex reasoning (including the previously released Ring-1T-preview), and Ming multimodal models capable of processing images, text, audio, and video.\\nThis diversified approach extends to an experimental model designated LLaDA-MoE, which employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\u2014a technique that activates only relevant portions of a large model for specific tasks, theoretically improving efficiency.\\nHe Zhengyu, chief technology officer at Ant Group, articulated the company\u2019s positioning around these releases. \u201cAt Ant Group, we believe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) should be a public good\u2014a shared milestone for humanity\u2019s intelligent future,\u201d He stated, adding that the open-source releases of both the trillion-parameter AI model and Ring-1T-preview represent steps toward \u201copen and collaborative advancement.\u201d\\nCompetitive dynamics in a constrained environment\\nThe timing and nature of Ant Group\u2019s releases illuminate strategic calculations within China\u2019s AI sector. With access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology limited by export restrictions, Chinese technology firms have increasingly emphasised algorithmic innovation and software optimisation as competitive differentiators.\\nByteDance, parent company of TikTok, similarly introduced a diffusion language model called Seed Diffusion Preview in July, claiming five-fold speed improvements over comparable autoregressive architectures. These parallel efforts suggest industry-wide interest in alternative model paradigms that might offer efficiency advantages.\\nHowever, the practical adoption trajectory for diffusion language models remains uncertain. Autoregressive systems continue dominating commercial deployments due to proven performance in natural language understanding and generation\u2014the core requirements for customer-facing applications.\\nOpen-source strategy as market positioning\\nBy making the trillion-parameter AI model publicly available alongside the dInfer framework, Ant Group is pursuing a collaborative development model that contrasts with the closed approaches of some competitors.\xa0\\nThis strategy potentially accelerates innovation while positioning Ant\u2019s technologies as foundational infrastructure for the broader AI community.\\nThe company is simultaneously developing AWorld, a framework intended to support continual learning in autonomous AI agents\u2014systems designed to complete tasks independently on behalf of users.\\nWhether these combined efforts can establish Ant Group as a significant force in global AI development depends partly on real-world validation of the performance claims and partly on adoption rates among developers seeking alternatives to established platforms.\xa0\\nThe trillion-parameter AI model\u2019s open-source nature may facilitate this validation process while building a community of users invested in the technology\u2019s success.\\nFor now, the releases demonstrate that major Chinese technology firms view the current AI landscape as fluid enough to accommodate new entrants willing to innovate across multiple dimensions simultaneously.\\nSee also: Ant Group uses domestic chips to train AI models and cut costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

The question for enterprises becomes: how do you build infrastructure and platforms capable of supporting this level of autonomous operation?\\n\\n\\nWhat do tomatoes and cement have in common? Watch a behind-the-scenes taster of how Huawei & Conch Group use AI to reshape the construction industry! Next up on the intelligent transformation menu: a mouthwatering new era of architecture\u2014smarter, faster, cheaper, greener!  pic.twitter.com/hEVIQ0xtUZ\\n\u2014 Huawei (@Huawei) August 28, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInfrastructure challenges drive new computing\xa0architectures\\nThe computational demands of agentic AI systems have exposed limitations in traditional cloud architectures, particularly as foundation model training and inference\xa0requirements\xa0surge.\xa0\\nHuawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0response involves\xa0CloudMatrix384\xa0supernodes connected through a high-speed MatrixLink network, creating what the company describes as a flexible hybrid compute system\xa0combining\xa0general-purpose and intelligent compute capabilities.\\nThe architecture\xa0specifically addresses\xa0bottlenecks in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models through expert parallelism inference, which reduces NPU idle time during data transfers. According to the\xa0company\u2019s\xa0technical specifications, this approach boosts single-PU inference speed 4-5 times compared to other popular models.\xa0\\nThe system also incorporates memory-centric AI-Native Storage designed for typical AI tasks, aimed at enhancing both training and inference efficiency. ModelBest, a company specialising in general-purpose AI and device intelligence, demonstrated practical applications of this infrastructure.\xa0\\nLi Dahai, co-founder and CEO of ModelBest, detailed how their MiniCPM series\u2014spanning foundation models, multi-modal capabilities, and full-modality integration\u2014integrates with Huawei Cloud AI Compute Service to achieve 20% improvements in training energy efficiency and 10% performance gains over industry standards.\xa0\\nThe MiniCPM models have found applications in automotive systems, smartphones, embodied AI, and AI-enabled personal computers.\\nFrom foundation models to industry-specific applications\\nThe challenge of adapting foundation models for specific industry needs has driven the development of more sophisticated training methodologies.\xa0Huawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0approach encompasses three key components: a\xa0complete\xa0data pipeline\xa0handling\xa0collection through management, a ready-to-use incremental training workflow, and\xa0a smart\xa0evaluation platform with preset evaluation sets.\\nThe incremental training workflow reportedly boosts model performance by 20-30% through automatic adjustment of data and training settings based on core model features and industry-specific objectives. The evaluation platform enables quick setup of systems aligned with industry or company benchmarks, addressing both accuracy and speed requirements.\\nReal-world implementations illustrate the practical application of these methodologies. Shaanxi Cultural Industry Investment Group partnered with Huawei to integrate AI with cultural tourism operations.\xa0\\nHuang Yong, Chairman of Shaanxi Cultural Industry Investment Group, explained that using Huawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0data-AI convergence platform, the organisation combined diverse cultural tourism data to create comprehensive datasets spanning history, film, and intangible heritage.\\nThe partnership established what\xa0they term\xa0a\xa0\u201ctrusted national data space for cultural tourism\u201d\xa0on Huawei Cloud, enabling applications\xa0including\xa0asset verification, copyright\xa0transaction, enterprise credit enhancement, and creative development.\xa0\\nThe collaboration\xa0produced\xa0the Boguan cultural tourism model, which powers AI-driven tools, including a cultural tourism intelligent brain, smart management assistant, intelligent travel assistant, and an\xa0AI\xa0short video platform.\\nInternational implementations demonstrate similar patterns. Dubai Municipality worked with Huawei Cloud to integrate foundation models, virtual humans, digital twins, and geographical information systems into urban systems.\xa0Mariam Almheiri, CEO of the Building Regulation and Permits Agency at Dubai Municipality,\xa0shared\xa0how this integration has\xa0improved\xa0city planning, facility management, and emergency\xa0responses.\\nEnterprise-grade agent platforms emerge\\nThe distinction between consumer-focused AI agents and enterprise-grade agentic AI systems centres on integration requirements and operational complexity. Enterprise systems must seamlessly integrate into broader workflows, handle complex situations, and meet higher operational standards than consumer applications\xa0designed\xa0for quick interactions.\\nHuawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0Versatile platform addresses this gap by providing infrastructure for businesses to create agents tailored to production needs. The platform combines AI compute, models, data platforms, tools, and ecosystem capabilities to streamline agent development through deployment, release, usage, and management phases.\\nConch\xa0Group\u2019s\xa0implementation in cement manufacturing offers specific performance metrics.\xa0The company partnered with Huawei to create what\xa0they describe\xa0as the cement\xa0industry\u2019s\xa0first AI-powered cement and building materials\xa0model.\xa0\\nThe resulting cement agents\xa0predict\xa0clinker strength at 3 and 28 days\xa0with\xa0predictions deviating\xa0less\xa0than 1 MPa from actual results, representing over 90% accuracy.\xa0For cement calcination optimisation, the model suggests key process parameters and operational solutions that cut standard coal usage by 1% compared to class A energy efficiency standards.\\nXu Yue, Assistant to Conch\xa0Cement\u2019s\xa0General Manager, noted that the\xa0model\u2019s\xa0success with quality control, production optimisation, equipment management, and safety establishes groundwork for end-to-end collaboration and decision-making through cement agents, moving the industry\xa0\u201cfrom relying on traditional expertise to being fully driven by data across all processes.\u201d\\nIn corporate travel management, Smartcom developed a travel agent using Huawei Cloud Versatile that provides end-to-end\xa0smart\xa0services across departure, transfers, and flights. Kong Xianghong, CTO of Shenzhen Smartcom and Director of Smartcom Solutions, reported that the system combines travel industry data, company policies, and individual trip histories to generate recommendations.\xa0\\nEmployees adopt over half of these suggestions and complete bookings in under two minutes. The agent resolves 80% of issues in an average of three interactions through predictive question matching.\\nWhat\u2019s\xa0next for autonomous AI?\\nThe implementations discussed at the summit reflect a broader industry trend toward agentic AI systems that operate with increasing autonomy within defined parameters.\xa0The\xa0technology\u2019s\xa0progression from reactive tools to systems capable of planning and executing complex tasks independently represents a fundamental\xa0architectural\xa0shift in enterprise computing.\\nHowever, the transition requires substantial infrastructure investments, sophisticated data engineering, and careful integration with existing business processes.

tech conferences can be overwhelming, especially if you&rsquo;re introverted, anxious, or are used to spending most of your day behind your computer. (Which is most of us.) And that&rsquo;s okay!&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The good news is that GitHub Universe was designed for folks like you. This isn&rsquo;t just one long conference in a room with thousands of people and no exit. Universe offers all sorts of opportunities to take breaks, hang in small groups, or watch virtually, so that you can learn and network at whatever pace works for you. We&rsquo;ve built in events to make the experience extra comfortable, safe, and exciting for all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>[<a href=\\"https://githubuniverse.com/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=tech_conference_introvert\\">Get your IRL pass</a>]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve already got your pass but are feeling a bit shaky on how it&rsquo;ll all go, here are some practical tips for how to navigate tech conferences, like GitHub Universe.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-1-attend-smaller-sessions-or-workshops\\">1. Attend smaller sessions or workshops</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Instead of signing up for the largest, busiest sessions, go for the smaller workshops, niche panels, and breakout sessions. Small-group sessions often foster deeper connections and conversations, and they can help keep you from getting lost in the crowd.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year&rsquo;s Universe will feature many <strong>interactive workshops</strong> (<a href=\\"https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?search.sessiontype=1681826483038003zyr1\\">explore the full list</a>), where the guest list will be small, and the conversations will be deep. You can also add demo-style<strong> sandbox sessions </strong>to your agenda, which include practical exercises, to keep your mind engaged!&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You may also want to check out gatherings in our <strong>discussions lounge</strong>, where two to three facilitators will guide small groups through specific topics of interest, prioritizing active participation and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" height=\\"683\\" width=\\"1024\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\\" alt=\\"Attendees working on laptops during conference session in presentation room.\\" class=\\"wp-image-91608\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=1536 1536w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-2-find-quiet-zones-and-recharge-spaces\\">2. Find quiet zones and recharge spaces</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We all know that introverts recharge alone. So if you need to step away and take some time to reflect, you should!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At Universe, we&rsquo;ve created <strong>dedicated lounges and recharge spaces</strong>, so you don&rsquo;t have to choose between skipping content and protecting your peace. Need a few minutes to unwind? We&rsquo;ll have a quiet room for phone-free decompression, meditation, and prayer. We&rsquo;ll also have plenty of drink options, snacks, and meals available if you need to keep your blood sugar up.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to step outside and take in the stunning waterfront views at Fort Mason&mdash;a quick breath of ocean air can do wonders between sessions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" decoding=\\"async\\" height=\\"683\\" width=\\"1024\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\\" alt=\\"Sunset view across the bay with birds flying over water and hills in background.\\" class=\\"wp-image-91609\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?w=1536 1536w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-3-join-curated-networking-activities\\">3.

(Which is most of us.) And that\u2019s okay!\xa0\\nThe good news is that GitHub Universe was designed for folks like you. This isn\u2019t just one long conference in a room with thousands of people and no exit. Universe offers all sorts of opportunities to take breaks, hang in small groups, or watch virtually, so that you can learn and network at whatever pace works for you. We\u2019ve built in events to make the experience extra comfortable, safe, and exciting for all.\\n[Get your IRL pass]\\nIf you\u2019ve already got your pass but are feeling a bit shaky on how it\u2019ll all go, here are some practical tips for how to navigate tech conferences, like GitHub Universe.\\n1. Attend smaller sessions or workshops\\nInstead of signing up for the largest, busiest sessions, go for the smaller workshops, niche panels, and breakout sessions. Small-group sessions often foster deeper connections and conversations, and they can help keep you from getting lost in the crowd.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s Universe will feature many interactive workshops (explore the full list), where the guest list will be small, and the conversations will be deep. You can also add demo-style sandbox sessions to your agenda, which include practical exercises, to keep your mind engaged!\xa0\\nYou may also want to check out gatherings in our discussions lounge, where two to three facilitators will guide small groups through specific topics of interest, prioritizing active participation and collaboration.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Find quiet zones and recharge spaces\\nWe all know that introverts recharge alone. So if you need to step away and take some time to reflect, you should!\\nAt Universe, we\u2019ve created dedicated lounges and recharge spaces, so you don\u2019t have to choose between skipping content and protecting your peace. Need a few minutes to unwind? We\u2019ll have a quiet room for phone-free decompression, meditation, and prayer. We\u2019ll also have plenty of drink options, snacks, and meals available if you need to keep your blood sugar up.\\nAnd don\u2019t forget to step outside and take in the stunning waterfront views at Fort Mason\u2014a quick breath of ocean air can do wonders between sessions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Join curated networking activities\\nIf large mixers without a planned topic of conversation feel daunting, you can look for guided or themed activities where the conversation already has a starting point.\xa0\\nAt Universe, you can connect with people who share your passions at structured networking meetup spots, including:\xa0\\nRecess!: Meet fellow attendees over your shared interests beyond the code. Whether you\u2019re a Lego enthusiast or a die-hard Swiftie, there\u2019s an opportunity for everyone to connect and simply have fun.\\nMakerspace: Create interactive projects, from art to AI and music to robotics. Whether you build or just tinker, this is your playground.\\nOpen Source Zone: Connect with contributors and maintainers, explore open source projects, and celebrate the power of community-led software.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Set personal goals and boundaries\\nDecide ahead of time what you want to get out of the event. Take a look at the agenda. What are your must-see sessions? Who are the people you want to meet? Build in plenty of breaks\u2014without guilt!\xa0\\nDid you know that we offer a Universe agenda builder, curated schedules, and content tracks, so you can figure out the right sessions for your interests and goals? This makes it simple to stick to your plan (and pace yourself!).\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Bring a conversation starter\\nWearing a T-shirt, pin, or sticker related to your passions makes it easy for someone else to approach you. It may even give you the confidence to approach someone else, too.\xa0\\nUniverse swag (and plenty of community stickers) are designed to help spark those natural, low-pressure conversations. And if you don\u2019t have any swag before the event, you can always visit The GitHub Shop and grab something day-of. We\u2019ll have a brand new GitHub Universe collection, so you\u2019ll be able to rep our latest and greatest.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Take it online with livestream or on-demand sessions\\nIf attending in-person still doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t forget that you can attend GitHub Universe virtually or catch keynotes and select session recordings later on-demand. Our goal: Make sure you can still participate and stay connected in a way that works best for you.\xa0\\nTo note: This might not always be an option at other tech conferences or events, but it\u2019s always worth checking to see if there are ways to learn and connect from home if that\u2019s your preferred method.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nWe hope you see you at GitHub Universe this year. Don\u2019t forget that however you plan to attend\u2014in-person, virtually, just a few workshops, or somewhere in between\u2014it\u2019s all in your control.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on <em>real</em> repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.</p>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"from-idea-to-merge-in-record-time-%e2%9a%a1\\">From idea to merge in record time &#9889;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext-edit suggestions: Copilot predicts the next change you\u2019ll make and offers it inline. One Tab and you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow-latency completions: Most Copilot responses now render in under 400 ms (fast enough that you stop noticing them).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopilot CLI: The same brains, now in your terminal. Setup, debug, and script without switching windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMulti-model routing: Different jobs call for different brains. Copilot gives you access to multiple LLMs from leading frontier AI firms.\xa0\\nThe result: fewer interruptions, faster loops, and a workflow that finally keeps pace with how you think.\\nAI that scales with your workflow \ud83d\udcd0\\nCopilot doesn\u2019t live in a new environment you need to learn. It\u2019s part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\xa0\\nJetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity: Same Copilot, wherever you build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom instructions: Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGitHub MCP Server: Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkspace prompt files: Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20M+ developers strong: Every Copilot update compounds through the world\u2019s largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\\nCopilot isn\u2019t a separate tool you \u201cadd\u201d to GitHub. It\u2019s part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\\nSmarter, cleaner, and safer code \ud83d\udd0d\\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know). We\u2019ve spent a lot of cycles quietly leveling up Copilot\u2019s overall code quality and security guardrails where they matter most to you.\xa0\\nCopilot Autofix: Detects and patches vulnerabilities automatically (it was used to fix over a million vulnerabilities this year alone).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCode review: Summarizes diffs, flags logic bugs, and suggests fixes right inside your pull requests with a tool that powers millions of code reviews a month on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImproved model reasoning: Generates more readable, test-passing code with fewer lint errors and less regressions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL integration: Integrations with GitHub Advanced Security, Dependabot, and GitHub Actions keeps your supply chain solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilt-in privacy: Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant-level control mean your work stays off the grid.\xa0\\nOur research shows new code written with Copilot tends to have higher readability, better reliability, and improved maintainability scores.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s the good news: Copilot\u2019s backed by the same security stack that protects the world\u2019s largest open source ecosystem and more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal talk: Copilot vs. the rest \ud83d\udc40\\nLet\u2019s be honest: there are some great tools out there that make agentic coding workflows feel intuitive and bring real polish to multi-file editing.\xa0\\nCopilot lives in GitHub.

Models work better with English context.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Structural analysis: </strong>COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you&rsquo;ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they&rsquo;re predictable. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>COBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>ENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>DATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>PROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ask GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you.

You don&rsquo;t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL&rsquo;s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Documentation as source of truth:</strong> Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference.

This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Julia&rsquo;s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what this orchestration looks like in practice:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Call chain mapping:</strong> Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact.

The tests become your safety net during migration.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Dependency optimization:</strong> Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you&rsquo;re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Think of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line.

We\u2019re talking about COBOL, a programming language that\u2019s been around for 65 years. That\u2019s older than the internet.\\nNow, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014COBOL isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, it\u2019s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.\\nThe problem? Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns. The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.\\nBut here\u2019s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.\\nMeet the developer who\u2019s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)\\nI recently spoke with Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who\u2019s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What\u2019s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.\\nJulia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn\u2019t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions. The COBOL experts provided the legacy system knowledge.\\nWhen this whole idea of Gen AI appeared, we were thinking about how we can actually use AI to solve this problem that has not been really solved yet.\\nJulia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt\\nThe three-step framework for AI-powered legacy modernization\\nJulia and her team at Microsoft have cracked the code (pun intended) with a systematic approach that works for any legacy modernization project, not just COBOL. Here\u2019s their GitHub Copilot powered, battle-tested framework.\\nStep 1: Code preparation (reverse engineering)\\nThe biggest problem with legacy systems? Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool. Instead of hiring consultants to spend months analyzing code, you can use AI to:\\nExtract business logic from legacy files.\\nDocument everything in markdown for human review.\\nAutomatically identify call chains and dependencies.\\nClean up irrelevant comments and historical logs.\\nAdd additional information as comments where needed.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Always have human experts review AI-generated analysis. AI is incredible at pattern recognition, but domain knowledge still matters for business context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s what GitHub Copilot generates for you:\xa0\\n# Business Logic Analysis Generated by GitHub Copilot\\n## File Inventory\\n- listings.cobol: List management functionality (~100 lines)\\n- mainframe-example.cobol: Full mainframe program (~10K lines, high complexity)\\n\\n## Business Purpose\\nCustomer account validation with balance checking\\n- Validates account numbers against master file\\n- Performs balance calculations with overdraft protection\\n- Generates transaction logs for audit compliance\\n\\n## Dependencies Discovered\\n- DB2 database connections via SQLCA\\n- External validation service calls\\n- Legacy print queue system\\nStep 2: Enrichment (making code AI-digestible)\\nYou usually need to add context to help AI understand your code better. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\\nTranslation: If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.\\nStructural analysis: COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you\u2019ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they\u2019re predictable. Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL\u2019s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.\\nDocumentation as source of truth: Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: \u201cEverything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.\u201d\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: COBOL\u2019s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid chart example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality check: It\u2019s not a silver bullet\\nJulia\u2019s brutally honest about limitations:\\nEveryone who\u2019s currently promising you, \u2018hey, I can solve all your mainframe problems with just one click\u2019 is lying to you.\\nThe reality is:\\nHumans must stay in the loop for validation.\\nEach COBOL codebase is unique and complex.\\nWe\u2019re early in the agentic AI journey.\\nFull automation is probably at least five years away.\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make massive progress today.\\nSee it in action: the Azure samples framework\\nJulia and her team have open-sourced their entire framework. It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt.

Just you, your terminal, and an AI that can actually help you get things done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall once, authenticate, and start working\\nWith Copilot CLI, you don\u2019t have to juggle your API keys.

Instead of scrolling through files manually or piecing it together from the README, ask Copilot to explain it for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou say: Explain the layout of this project.\\nCopilot inspects the repository using find, tree, and the README, then returns a clean Markdown summary.

A2AS enforces certified behavior, activates model self-defense, and ensures context window integrity. It defines security boundaries, authenticates prompts, applies security rules and custom policies, and controls agentic behavior, enabling a defense-in-depth strategy. The A2AS framework avoids latency overhead, external dependencies, architectural changes, model retraining, and operational complexity. The BASIC security model is introduced as the A2AS foundation: (B) Behavior certificates enable behavior enforcement, (A) Authenticated prompts enable context window integrity, (S) Security boundaries enable untrusted input isolation, (I) In-context defenses enable secure model reasoning, (C) Codified policies enable application-specific rules.

In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method that is both effective and efficient.

Leveraging this insight, we train a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a labeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11 baselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.</p></div>\\n<h2>BOTNETS R US</h2>\\n<p>Ferguson said he&#8217;s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet&#8217;s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.</p></div>\\n<p>Dobbins said Aisuru&#8217;s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here).

The complaint alleges the group&#8217;s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.</p>\\n<p>U.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair&#8217;s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.</p>\\n<p>The complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.\\nAt a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled Transport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.\\n\\nA court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity reported that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider ransom attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group.\\nThat story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group\u2019s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.\\nThe story also noted that Jubair\u2019s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair\u2019s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.\\nEARLY DAYS (2021-2022)\\nJubair is alleged to have been a core member of the LAPSUS$\xa0cybercrime group that\xa0broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including\xa0Microsoft,\xa0Nvidia,\xa0Okta,\xa0Rockstar Games,\xa0Samsung,\xa0T-Mobile, and\xa0Uber.\\nThat is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames Amtrak\xa0and\xa0Asyntax. In the middle of the gang\u2019s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\\nThe leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax\u2019s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:\\n\\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair\u2019s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\\n\\n\\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including \u201cEverlynn,\u201d who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d\xa0targeting the major social media and email providers.\\nIn these so-called \u201cfake EDR\u201d schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\\n\\nThe roster of the now-defunct \u201cInfinity Recursion\u201d hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder \u201cEverlynn\u201d has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as \u201cPeter\u201d became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair\u2019s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$\u2019s chat channel.\\n\\n\\nEARTHTOSTAR\\nProsecutors in New Jersey last week alleged Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, 0ktapus, and UNC3944, and that he used the nicknames EarthtoStar, Brad, Austin, and Austistic.\\nBeginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called Star Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nJubair allegedly used the handle \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.\\n\\nThe group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target\u2019s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim\u2019s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.\\nIn February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with \u201cTmo up!\u201d and \u201cTmo down!\u201d notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile\u2019s network.\\n\\nA redacted receipt from Star Chat\u2019s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.\\n\\nThe data showed that Star Chat \u2014 along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time \u2014 collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.\\n\\nThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.\\n\\nA review of EarthtoStar\u2019s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint shows this person also sold \u201cAT&T email resets\u201d and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:\\n\u201cOk people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says \u20182fa required\u2019 or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?\u201d\\n\\nNew Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022 that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer\u2019s Okta authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.\\nThe phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.\\nThat weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, Plex and Signal.\\n\\nA visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.\\n\\nDA, COMRADE\\nEarthtoStar\u2019s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel \u201cFrauwudchat\u201d:\\n\u201cHi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API\u2019s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.\u201d\\n\\nAt around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat \u2014 \u201cRocketAce\u201d and \u201cLopiu\u201d \u2014 introduced the group\u2019s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit, including:\\n-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;\\n\\nThe user \u201cLopiu\u201d on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.\\n\\nThese two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar\u2019s many aliases, posted to Exploit:\\nHello. I have access to a telecommunications company\u2019s citrix and vpn. I would like someone to help me break out of the system and potentially attack the domain controller so all logins can be extracted we can discuss payment and things leave your telegram in the comments or private message me ! Looking for someone with knowledge in citrix/privilege escalation\\n\\nOn Nov. 15, 2022, EarthtoStar posted to their Star Sanctuary Telegram channel that they were hiring malware developers with a minimum of three years of experience and the ability to develop rootkits, backdoors and malware loaders.\\n\u201cOptional: Endorsed by advanced APT Groups (e.g. Conti, Ryuk),\u201d the ad concluded, referencing two of Russia\u2019s most rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate operations. \u201cPart of a nation-state / ex-3l (3 letter-agency).\u201d\\n2023-PRESENT DAY\\nThe Telegram and Discord chat channels wherein Flowers and Jubair allegedly planned and executed their extortion attacks are part of a loose-knit network known as the Com, an English-speaking cybercrime community consisting mostly of individuals living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\\nMany of these Com chat servers have hundreds to thousands of members each, and some of the more interesting solicitations on these communities are job offers for in-person assignments and tasks that can be found if one searches for posts titled, \u201cIf you live near,\u201d or \u201cIRL job\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cin real life\u201d job.\\nThese \u201cviolence-as-a-service\u201d solicitations typically involve \u201cbrickings,\u201d where someone is hired to toss a brick through the window at a specified address. Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it\u2019s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.\\nIt remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department\u2019s website, along with the message:\\n\u201cNeed irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either\u201d\\n\\nThroughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar\u2019s alias \u201cBrad\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cBrad_banned\u201d) frequently advertised Star Chat\u2019s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker\u2019s presence on a victim machine:\\nWe can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,\\nThis shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!\\nKernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.\\nBypass all major EDR\u2019s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)\\nOnce implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)\\nBe one step ahead of the game. Prices start from $5,000+. Message @brad_banned to get a quote\\n\\nIn September 2023 , both MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment suffered ransomware attacks at the hands of a Russian ransomware affiliate program known as ALPHV and BlackCat. Caesars reportedly paid a $15 million ransom in that incident.\\nWithin hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they\u2019d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.\\nThe Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.\\nIn April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of \u201cThe Com Cast,\u201d a lengthy screed detailing Jubair\u2019s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years. This account included photos and voice recordings allegedly of Jubair, and asserted that in his early days on the Com Jubair used the nicknames Clark and Miku (these are both aliases used by Everlynn in connection with their fake EDR services).\\n\\nThalha Jubair (right), without his large-rimmed glasses, in an undated photo posted in The Com Cast.\\n\\nMore recently, the anonymous Com Cast author(s) claimed, Jubair had used the nickname \u201cOperator,\u201d which corresponds to a Com member who ran an automated Telegram-based doxing service that pulled consumer records from hacked data broker accounts. That public outing came after Operator allegedly seized control over the Doxbin, a long-running and highly toxic community that is used to \u201cdox\u201d or post deeply personal information on people.\\n\u201cOperator/Clark/Miku: A key member of the ransomware group Scattered Spider, which consists of a diverse mix of individuals involved in SIM swapping and phishing,\u201d the Com Cast account stated. \u201cThe group is an amalgamation of several key organizations, including Infinity Recursion (owned by Operator), True Alcorians (owned by earth2star), and Lapsus, which have come together to form a single collective.\u201d\\nThe New Jersey complaint (PDF) alleges Jubair and other Scattered Spider members committed computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in relation to at least 120 computer network intrusions involving 47 U.S. entities between May 2022 and September 2025. The complaint alleges the group\u2019s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.\\nU.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair\u2019s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.\\nThe complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida man charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.\\nUrban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.\\n\\nNoah \u201cKingbob\u201d Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.\\n\\nA\xa0court transcript (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban\u2019s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.\\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B, and easily one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.\\nIn the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing \u2014 and very often bragging about \u2014 serious cybercrime offenses.\\n\u201cHere we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cMost get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.\u201d\\nNixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they\u2019re released.\\nIndeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.\\n\u201cWhat we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.\u201d\\nNixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if\xa0the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.\\n\u201cIf law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,\u201d she said.\\nThe Times of London reports that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.\\nJubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.\\nIn the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. If extradited to the U.S., tried and convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison.\\nIn July 2025, the United Kingdom barred victims of hacking from paying ransoms to cybercriminal groups unless approved by officials. U.K. organizations that are considered part of critical infrastructure reportedly will face a complete ban, as will the entire public sector.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\nVideo footage of the assault taken by The LA Ten Four shows the man being punched, kicked and stomped on by several others. At least two of the attackers appear to be wearing SoCal Active Club t-shirts, identifiable as such by photos and videos posted from the vigil.\\n\\nA frame from video footage filmed by LA Ten Four of the assault, showing one of several men wearing shirts with SoCal Active Club\u2019s logo; the individual second from right of the photo in the SoCal Active Club t-shirt can be seen in the video kicking the man on the ground. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\n\\nFrames from a video posted by Patriot Front, and shared by the main Active Club Telegram channel, showing several individuals wearing the same SoCal Active Club t-shirts at the same event before the alleged assault.\\nSoCal Active Club has not responded to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment on their apparent involvement in this assault as of publication.\\nWiley D.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat.

No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d.

Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right).

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions.

This parallel release strategy reflects the company\u2019s bet on multiple technological approaches rather than a single architectural paradigm.\\nDiffusion language models represent a departure from the autoregressive systems that underpin widely used chatbots like ChatGPT. Unlike sequential text generation, diffusion models produce outputs in parallel\u2014an approach already prevalent in image and video generation tools but less common in language processing.\\nAnt Group\u2019s performance metrics for dInfer suggest substantial efficiency gains. Testing on the company\u2019s LLaDA-MoE diffusion model yielded 1,011 tokens per second on the HumanEval coding benchmark, versus 91 tokens per second for Nvidia\u2019s Fast-dLLM framework and 294 for Alibaba\u2019s Qwen-2.5-3B model running on vLLM infrastructure.\\n\u201cWe believe that dInfer provides both a practical toolkit and a standardised platform to accelerate research and development in the rapidly growing field of dLLMs,\u201d researchers at Ant Group noted in accompanying technical documentation.\\nEcosystem expansion beyond language models\\nThe Ling-1T trillion-parameter AI model sits within a broader family of AI systems that Ant Group has assembled over recent months.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company\u2019s portfolio now spans three primary series: the Ling non-thinking models for standard language tasks, Ring thinking models designed for complex reasoning (including the previously released Ring-1T-preview), and Ming multimodal models capable of processing images, text, audio, and video.\\nThis diversified approach extends to an experimental model designated LLaDA-MoE, which employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\u2014a technique that activates only relevant portions of a large model for specific tasks, theoretically improving efficiency.\\nHe Zhengyu, chief technology officer at Ant Group, articulated the company\u2019s positioning around these releases. \u201cAt Ant Group, we believe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) should be a public good\u2014a shared milestone for humanity\u2019s intelligent future,\u201d He stated, adding that the open-source releases of both the trillion-parameter AI model and Ring-1T-preview represent steps toward \u201copen and collaborative advancement.\u201d\\nCompetitive dynamics in a constrained environment\\nThe timing and nature of Ant Group\u2019s releases illuminate strategic calculations within China\u2019s AI sector. With access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology limited by export restrictions, Chinese technology firms have increasingly emphasised algorithmic innovation and software optimisation as competitive differentiators.\\nByteDance, parent company of TikTok, similarly introduced a diffusion language model called Seed Diffusion Preview in July, claiming five-fold speed improvements over comparable autoregressive architectures. These parallel efforts suggest industry-wide interest in alternative model paradigms that might offer efficiency advantages.\\nHowever, the practical adoption trajectory for diffusion language models remains uncertain. Autoregressive systems continue dominating commercial deployments due to proven performance in natural language understanding and generation\u2014the core requirements for customer-facing applications.\\nOpen-source strategy as market positioning\\nBy making the trillion-parameter AI model publicly available alongside the dInfer framework, Ant Group is pursuing a collaborative development model that contrasts with the closed approaches of some competitors.\xa0\\nThis strategy potentially accelerates innovation while positioning Ant\u2019s technologies as foundational infrastructure for the broader AI community.\\nThe company is simultaneously developing AWorld, a framework intended to support continual learning in autonomous AI agents\u2014systems designed to complete tasks independently on behalf of users.\\nWhether these combined efforts can establish Ant Group as a significant force in global AI development depends partly on real-world validation of the performance claims and partly on adoption rates among developers seeking alternatives to established platforms.\xa0\\nThe trillion-parameter AI model\u2019s open-source nature may facilitate this validation process while building a community of users invested in the technology\u2019s success.\\nFor now, the releases demonstrate that major Chinese technology firms view the current AI landscape as fluid enough to accommodate new entrants willing to innovate across multiple dimensions simultaneously.\\nSee also: Ant Group uses domestic chips to train AI models and cut costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

The question for enterprises becomes: how do you build infrastructure and platforms capable of supporting this level of autonomous operation?\\n\\n\\nWhat do tomatoes and cement have in common? Watch a behind-the-scenes taster of how Huawei & Conch Group use AI to reshape the construction industry! Next up on the intelligent transformation menu: a mouthwatering new era of architecture\u2014smarter, faster, cheaper, greener!  pic.twitter.com/hEVIQ0xtUZ\\n\u2014 Huawei (@Huawei) August 28, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInfrastructure challenges drive new computing\xa0architectures\\nThe computational demands of agentic AI systems have exposed limitations in traditional cloud architectures, particularly as foundation model training and inference\xa0requirements\xa0surge.\xa0\\nHuawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0response involves\xa0CloudMatrix384\xa0supernodes connected through a high-speed MatrixLink network, creating what the company describes as a flexible hybrid compute system\xa0combining\xa0general-purpose and intelligent compute capabilities.\\nThe architecture\xa0specifically addresses\xa0bottlenecks in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models through expert parallelism inference, which reduces NPU idle time during data transfers. According to the\xa0company\u2019s\xa0technical specifications, this approach boosts single-PU inference speed 4-5 times compared to other popular models.\xa0\\nThe system also incorporates memory-centric AI-Native Storage designed for typical AI tasks, aimed at enhancing both training and inference efficiency. ModelBest, a company specialising in general-purpose AI and device intelligence, demonstrated practical applications of this infrastructure.\xa0\\nLi Dahai, co-founder and CEO of ModelBest, detailed how their MiniCPM series\u2014spanning foundation models, multi-modal capabilities, and full-modality integration\u2014integrates with Huawei Cloud AI Compute Service to achieve 20% improvements in training energy efficiency and 10% performance gains over industry standards.\xa0\\nThe MiniCPM models have found applications in automotive systems, smartphones, embodied AI, and AI-enabled personal computers.\\nFrom foundation models to industry-specific applications\\nThe challenge of adapting foundation models for specific industry needs has driven the development of more sophisticated training methodologies.\xa0Huawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0approach encompasses three key components: a\xa0complete\xa0data pipeline\xa0handling\xa0collection through management, a ready-to-use incremental training workflow, and\xa0a smart\xa0evaluation platform with preset evaluation sets.\\nThe incremental training workflow reportedly boosts model performance by 20-30% through automatic adjustment of data and training settings based on core model features and industry-specific objectives. The evaluation platform enables quick setup of systems aligned with industry or company benchmarks, addressing both accuracy and speed requirements.\\nReal-world implementations illustrate the practical application of these methodologies. Shaanxi Cultural Industry Investment Group partnered with Huawei to integrate AI with cultural tourism operations.\xa0\\nHuang Yong, Chairman of Shaanxi Cultural Industry Investment Group, explained that using Huawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0data-AI convergence platform, the organisation combined diverse cultural tourism data to create comprehensive datasets spanning history, film, and intangible heritage.\\nThe partnership established what\xa0they term\xa0a\xa0\u201ctrusted national data space for cultural tourism\u201d\xa0on Huawei Cloud, enabling applications\xa0including\xa0asset verification, copyright\xa0transaction, enterprise credit enhancement, and creative development.\xa0\\nThe collaboration\xa0produced\xa0the Boguan cultural tourism model, which powers AI-driven tools, including a cultural tourism intelligent brain, smart management assistant, intelligent travel assistant, and an\xa0AI\xa0short video platform.\\nInternational implementations demonstrate similar patterns. Dubai Municipality worked with Huawei Cloud to integrate foundation models, virtual humans, digital twins, and geographical information systems into urban systems.\xa0Mariam Almheiri, CEO of the Building Regulation and Permits Agency at Dubai Municipality,\xa0shared\xa0how this integration has\xa0improved\xa0city planning, facility management, and emergency\xa0responses.\\nEnterprise-grade agent platforms emerge\\nThe distinction between consumer-focused AI agents and enterprise-grade agentic AI systems centres on integration requirements and operational complexity. Enterprise systems must seamlessly integrate into broader workflows, handle complex situations, and meet higher operational standards than consumer applications\xa0designed\xa0for quick interactions.\\nHuawei\xa0Cloud\u2019s\xa0Versatile platform addresses this gap by providing infrastructure for businesses to create agents tailored to production needs. The platform combines AI compute, models, data platforms, tools, and ecosystem capabilities to streamline agent development through deployment, release, usage, and management phases.\\nConch\xa0Group\u2019s\xa0implementation in cement manufacturing offers specific performance metrics.\xa0The company partnered with Huawei to create what\xa0they describe\xa0as the cement\xa0industry\u2019s\xa0first AI-powered cement and building materials\xa0model.\xa0\\nThe resulting cement agents\xa0predict\xa0clinker strength at 3 and 28 days\xa0with\xa0predictions deviating\xa0less\xa0than 1 MPa from actual results, representing over 90% accuracy.\xa0For cement calcination optimisation, the model suggests key process parameters and operational solutions that cut standard coal usage by 1% compared to class A energy efficiency standards.\\nXu Yue, Assistant to Conch\xa0Cement\u2019s\xa0General Manager, noted that the\xa0model\u2019s\xa0success with quality control, production optimisation, equipment management, and safety establishes groundwork for end-to-end collaboration and decision-making through cement agents, moving the industry\xa0\u201cfrom relying on traditional expertise to being fully driven by data across all processes.\u201d\\nIn corporate travel management, Smartcom developed a travel agent using Huawei Cloud Versatile that provides end-to-end\xa0smart\xa0services across departure, transfers, and flights.

Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid chart example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality check: It\u2019s not a silver bullet\\nJulia\u2019s brutally honest about limitations:\\nEveryone who\u2019s currently promising you, \u2018hey, I can solve all your mainframe problems with just one click\u2019 is lying to you.\\nThe reality is:\\nHumans must stay in the loop for validation.\\nEach COBOL codebase is unique and complex.\\nWe\u2019re early in the agentic AI journey.\\nFull automation is probably at least five years away.\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make massive progress today.\\nSee it in action: the Azure samples framework\\nJulia and her team have open-sourced their entire framework. It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt. It\u2019s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.\\nThe traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that\u2019s unmaintainable. I\u2019ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don\u2019t understand in a language they\u2019re still learning.\\nThe AI-powered approach changes this. You use AI to understand business logic, generate human-readable modern code, and maintain control of your intellectual property. Your team stays involved throughout the process. They learn the business logic as they go. The code that comes out the other end is something your developers can actually work with.\\nJulia explained the shift:\\nWhat a lot of customers do not want to actually give all their intellectual property like a hundred percent to a partner anymore, right? They want to keep it in check.\\nStart here: your path to becoming the modernization hero\\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with COBOL, ancient Java, or any legacy system, here\u2019s how you can start today:\\nStart small\\nIdentify one problematic legacy system (start with fewer than 5,000 lines)\\nUse GitHub Copilot to analyze a single file\\nDocument what you discover in markdown\\nShare findings with your team\\nBuild your AI toolkit\\nExperiment with the Azure Samples framework\\nLearn prompt engineering for code analysis (try: \u201cAnalyze this COBOL program and explain its business purpose in simple terms\u201d)\\nPractice iterative modernization techniques\\nThink beyond code\\nConsider nonfunctional requirements for cloud-native design\\nPlan for distributed systems architecture\\nRemember: most COBOL programs are doing simple CRUD operations. They don\u2019t need the complexity of a mainframe. They need the simplicity of modern architecture.\\nHere\u2019s a challenge: Find a legacy system in your organization. Six-month-old code counts as legacy in our industry. Try using GitHub Copilot to:\\nGenerate business logic documentation\\nIdentify potential modernization opportunities\\nCreate a migration plan with human validation checkpoints\\nShare your results on LinkedIn and tag me. I\u2019d love to see what you discover.\\nThe best time to start is now\\nThe most powerful insight from my conversation with Julia is this: AI doesn\u2019t replace developer expertise. It amplifies it.\\nCOBOL experts bring irreplaceable domain knowledge. Modern developers bring fresh perspectives on architecture and best practices. AI brings pattern recognition and translation capabilities at scale.\\nWhen these three forces work together, legacy modernization transforms from an impossible challenge into an achievable project.\\nThe best time to modernize legacy code was 10 years ago. The second-best time is now.\\nSpecial thanks to Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who shared her insights and experiences that made this blog post possible.\\nReady to dive deeper? Check out the full blog post about this project at aka.ms/cobol-blog and connect with Julia on LinkedIn for the latest updates.\\nThe age of legacy code doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier anymore. With the right AI tools and framework, even 65-year-old COBOL can become approachable, maintainable, and modern.\\nWhat legacy system will you modernize next?

With Copilot CLI, I just defer these tasks straight to it. Maybe I\u2019ll remember the command next time, or maybe (probably) not. But I\u2019ll definitely ask Copilot again.\\nStay in control\\nCopilot always asks before running commands or accessing directories. This is critical when you\u2019re giving an AI access to run things on your machine.\\nBefore Copilot can execute anything, it will prompt you to:\\nAllow once\\nAllow always for this command\\nDeny\\nYou can also:\\nUse /session to view what\u2019s currently allowed\\nReset permissions at any time with /reset\\nAdd directories to your allowed list with /add-directory\\nExtend with MCP servers\\nCopilot CLI ships with the GitHub MCP server already installed and running. This is what powers the issue search and repository interactions. But you can add any MCP server you want from the registry using /mcp.\\nWant to add Playwright for browser testing? Or integrate with your company\u2019s internal tools? You can customize and extend Copilot CLI to match your workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy this matters\\nHere\u2019s what I appreciate most about Copilot CLI: It meets me where I already work. I spend a lot of time in the terminal anyway, jumping between repositories, checking logs, running builds. Having Copilot right there means I\u2019m not constantly switching contexts between my IDE, browser, and command line just to get AI help.\\nWhen I\u2019m onboarding contributors to our projects or exploring a new codebase myself, I can stay in that flow. I can ask about the project structure, verify dependencies, find issues to work on, and start implementing without bouncing around between tools. That consistency matters when you\u2019re trying to maintain momentum.\\nThis isn\u2019t about replacing your IDE. It\u2019s about having the right tool in the right place.\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next\\nCopilot CLI is in public preview, and your feedback will shape our roadmap. We have ideas for what\u2019s coming next, but we want to know what matters most to you.\\n\ud83d\udc49 Install it today with:\\nnpm install -g copilot\\nThen share your experience using /feedback.\\nStart using GitHub Copilot CLI >\\n\\nThe post GitHub Copilot CLI: How to get started appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"Andrea Griffiths","description":"<p>Discover how to use GitHub Copilot directly in the terminal.

considered abuse in itself.\\nAre there others that have similar experience?\\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45613567\\nPoints: 22\\n# Comments: 11"},{"creator":"Bartosz

(Which is most of us.) And that&rsquo;s okay!&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The good news is that GitHub Universe was designed for folks like you. This isn&rsquo;t just one long conference in a room with thousands of people and no exit. Universe offers all sorts of opportunities to take breaks, hang in small groups, or watch virtually, so that you can learn and network at whatever pace works for you.

Attend smaller sessions or workshops</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Instead of signing up for the largest, busiest sessions, go for the smaller workshops, niche panels, and breakout sessions. Small-group sessions often foster deeper connections and conversations, and they can help keep you from getting lost in the crowd.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year&rsquo;s Universe will feature many <strong>interactive workshops</strong> (<a href=\\"https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?search.sessiontype=1681826483038003zyr1\\">explore the full list</a>), where the guest list will be small, and the conversations will be deep. You can also add demo-style<strong> sandbox sessions </strong>to your agenda, which include practical exercises, to keep your mind engaged!&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You may also want to check out gatherings in our <strong>discussions lounge</strong>, where two to three facilitators will guide small groups through specific topics of interest, prioritizing active participation and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" height=\\"683\\" width=\\"1024\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\\" alt=\\"Attendees working on laptops during conference session in presentation room.\\" class=\\"wp-image-91608\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?w=1536 1536w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-2-find-quiet-zones-and-recharge-spaces\\">2.

So if you need to step away and take some time to reflect, you should!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At Universe, we&rsquo;ve created <strong>dedicated lounges and recharge spaces</strong>, so you don&rsquo;t have to choose between skipping content and protecting your peace. Need a few minutes to unwind? We&rsquo;ll have a quiet room for phone-free decompression, meditation, and prayer.

(Which is most of us.) And that\u2019s okay!\xa0\\nThe good news is that GitHub Universe was designed for folks like you. This isn\u2019t just one long conference in a room with thousands of people and no exit. Universe offers all sorts of opportunities to take breaks, hang in small groups, or watch virtually, so that you can learn and network at whatever pace works for you. We\u2019ve built in events to make the experience extra comfortable, safe, and exciting for all.\\n[Get your IRL pass]\\nIf you\u2019ve already got your pass but are feeling a bit shaky on how it\u2019ll all go, here are some practical tips for how to navigate tech conferences, like GitHub Universe.\\n1. Attend smaller sessions or workshops\\nInstead of signing up for the largest, busiest sessions, go for the smaller workshops, niche panels, and breakout sessions. Small-group sessions often foster deeper connections and conversations, and they can help keep you from getting lost in the crowd.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s Universe will feature many interactive workshops (explore the full list), where the guest list will be small, and the conversations will be deep. You can also add demo-style sandbox sessions to your agenda, which include practical exercises, to keep your mind engaged!\xa0\\nYou may also want to check out gatherings in our discussions lounge, where two to three facilitators will guide small groups through specific topics of interest, prioritizing active participation and collaboration.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Find quiet zones and recharge spaces\\nWe all know that introverts recharge alone. So if you need to step away and take some time to reflect, you should!\\nAt Universe, we\u2019ve created dedicated lounges and recharge spaces, so you don\u2019t have to choose between skipping content and protecting your peace. Need a few minutes to unwind? We\u2019ll have a quiet room for phone-free decompression, meditation, and prayer. We\u2019ll also have plenty of drink options, snacks, and meals available if you need to keep your blood sugar up.\\nAnd don\u2019t forget to step outside and take in the stunning waterfront views at Fort Mason\u2014a quick breath of ocean air can do wonders between sessions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Join curated networking activities\\nIf large mixers without a planned topic of conversation feel daunting, you can look for guided or themed activities where the conversation already has a starting point.\xa0\\nAt Universe, you can connect with people who share your passions at structured networking meetup spots, including:\xa0\\nRecess!: Meet fellow attendees over your shared interests beyond the code. Whether you\u2019re a Lego enthusiast or a die-hard Swiftie, there\u2019s an opportunity for everyone to connect and simply have fun.\\nMakerspace: Create interactive projects, from art to AI and music to robotics. Whether you build or just tinker, this is your playground.\\nOpen Source Zone: Connect with contributors and maintainers, explore open source projects, and celebrate the power of community-led software.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Set personal goals and boundaries\\nDecide ahead of time what you want to get out of the event. Take a look at the agenda. What are your must-see sessions? Who are the people you want to meet? Build in plenty of breaks\u2014without guilt!\xa0\\nDid you know that we offer a Universe agenda builder, curated schedules, and content tracks, so you can figure out the right sessions for your interests and goals? This makes it simple to stick to your plan (and pace yourself!).\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Bring a conversation starter\\nWearing a T-shirt, pin, or sticker related to your passions makes it easy for someone else to approach you. It may even give you the confidence to approach someone else, too.\xa0\\nUniverse swag (and plenty of community stickers) are designed to help spark those natural, low-pressure conversations. And if you don\u2019t have any swag before the event, you can always visit The GitHub Shop and grab something day-of. We\u2019ll have a brand new GitHub Universe collection, so you\u2019ll be able to rep our latest and greatest.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Take it online with livestream or on-demand sessions\\nIf attending in-person still doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t forget that you can attend GitHub Universe virtually or catch keynotes and select session recordings later on-demand. Our goal: Make sure you can still participate and stay connected in a way that works best for you.\xa0\\nTo note: This might not always be an option at other tech conferences or events, but it\u2019s always worth checking to see if there are ways to learn and connect from home if that\u2019s your preferred method.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nWe hope you see you at GitHub Universe this year. Don\u2019t forget that however you plan to attend\u2014in-person, virtually, just a few workshops, or somewhere in between\u2014it\u2019s all in your control.

unprotected Kafka broker like a post office that stores and delivers confidential mail. Now, imagine the manager leaves the front doors wide open, with no locks, guards, or ID checks. Anyone can walk in, look through private letters and photos, and grab whatever catches their eye.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Huddle01 is a video call app that focuses on decentralized Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). WebRTC is appealing because it lets people talk and share data directly between devices without using a central server. Done right, this can reduce latency, cut costs, and improve privacy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But leaving your Kafka broker open to anyone who happens to stumble upon it does not qualify as &#8220;doing privacy right.&#8221; The Kafka broker operated without authentication or encryption, meaning anyone could listen in, collect logs, or potentially alter data if write access existed. This demonstrates a fundamental misconfiguration that puts both users and the platform at risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Kafka instance contained over 621,000 log entries from the last 13 days, belonging to Huddle01, including:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>Usernames (sometimes real names)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Email addresses</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Crypto wallet addresses (Huddle01 supports many wallets across blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Detailed activity data, such as which users joined specific calls, participants in each call, country, time, date, and duration</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Other identifiers</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The app is popular among cryptocurrency users, but in this case the open Kafka instance could have deanonymized their wallets by tying their crypto wallets to usernames and email addresses. Which also paints a target on their back as potentially high-value targets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It also makes users more vulnerable to social engineering since attackers can craft credible emails or messages using real names and meeting data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And hold on for the worst part.

Now, imagine the manager leaves the front doors wide open, with no locks, guards, or ID checks. Anyone can walk in, look through private letters and photos, and grab whatever catches their eye.\\nHuddle01 is a video call app that focuses on decentralized Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). WebRTC is appealing because it lets people talk and share data directly between devices without using a central server. Done right, this can reduce latency, cut costs, and improve privacy.\\nBut leaving your Kafka broker open to anyone who happens to stumble upon it does not qualify as \u201cdoing privacy right.\u201d The Kafka broker operated without authentication or encryption, meaning anyone could listen in, collect logs, or potentially alter data if write access existed. This demonstrates a fundamental misconfiguration that puts both users and the platform at risk.\\nThe Kafka instance contained over 621,000 log entries from the last 13 days, belonging to Huddle01, including:\\nUsernames (sometimes real names)\\nEmail addresses\\nCrypto wallet addresses (Huddle01 supports many wallets across blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum)\\nDetailed activity data, such as which users joined specific calls, participants in each call, country, time, date, and duration\\nOther identifiers\\nThe app is popular among cryptocurrency users, but in this case the open Kafka instance could have deanonymized their wallets by tying their crypto wallets to usernames and email addresses. Which also paints a target on their back as potentially high-value targets.\\nIt also makes users more vulnerable to social engineering since attackers can craft credible emails or messages using real names and meeting data.\\nAnd hold on for the worst part. Cybernews states it responsibly disclosed the data leak to the company behind Huddle01\u2026\\n\u201cHowever, it did not respond to the initial disclosure and subsequent attempts. After one month, the exposed server remained accessible. It\u2019s unclear how many other third parties might have accessed the data.\u201d\\nSecurity tips for affected users\\nKnowing that the exposed information goes back about two weeks doesn\u2019t help much, since anyone with access could have set up a data collector, listening in on the real-time data streaming and processing going on.\\nSo, any Huddle01 users should:\\nChange passwords on accounts linked to the exposed email or username, and use strong, unique passwords for each site.\\nSet up two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible to prevent unauthorized access.\\nMonitor inboxes for suspicious messages. Be extra cautious of emails or texts asking for crypto transactions or sensitive information, as targeted phishing is a possibility. Be especially wary of social engineering attempts that reference details from meeting logs, such as who you spoke to or when meetings occurred.\\nStay updated on official statements from Huddle01 or news coverage, as they may release more guidance later.\\nPro tip: Did you know that you can submit suspicious messages like these to Malwarebytes Scam Guard, which instantly flags known scams?\\nWe don\u2019t just report on scams\u2014we help detect them\\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

This parallel release strategy reflects the company\u2019s bet on multiple technological approaches rather than a single architectural paradigm.\\nDiffusion language models represent a departure from the autoregressive systems that underpin widely used chatbots like ChatGPT. Unlike sequential text generation, diffusion models produce outputs in parallel\u2014an approach already prevalent in image and video generation tools but less common in language processing.\\nAnt Group\u2019s performance metrics for dInfer suggest substantial efficiency gains. Testing on the company\u2019s LLaDA-MoE diffusion model yielded 1,011 tokens per second on the HumanEval coding benchmark, versus 91 tokens per second for Nvidia\u2019s Fast-dLLM framework and 294 for Alibaba\u2019s Qwen-2.5-3B model running on vLLM infrastructure.\\n\u201cWe believe that dInfer provides both a practical toolkit and a standardised platform to accelerate research and development in the rapidly growing field of dLLMs,\u201d researchers at Ant Group noted in accompanying technical documentation.\\nEcosystem expansion beyond language models\\nThe Ling-1T trillion-parameter AI model sits within a broader family of AI systems that Ant Group has assembled over recent months.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company\u2019s portfolio now spans three primary series: the Ling non-thinking models for standard language tasks, Ring thinking models designed for complex reasoning (including the previously released Ring-1T-preview), and Ming multimodal models capable of processing images, text, audio, and video.\\nThis diversified approach extends to an experimental model designated LLaDA-MoE, which employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\u2014a technique that activates only relevant portions of a large model for specific tasks, theoretically improving efficiency.\\nHe Zhengyu, chief technology officer at Ant Group, articulated the company\u2019s positioning around these releases. \u201cAt Ant Group, we believe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) should be a public good\u2014a shared milestone for humanity\u2019s intelligent future,\u201d He stated, adding that the open-source releases of both the trillion-parameter AI model and Ring-1T-preview represent steps toward \u201copen and collaborative advancement.\u201d\\nCompetitive dynamics in a constrained environment\\nThe timing and nature of Ant Group\u2019s releases illuminate strategic calculations within China\u2019s AI sector. With access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology limited by export restrictions, Chinese technology firms have increasingly emphasised algorithmic innovation and software optimisation as competitive differentiators.\\nByteDance, parent company of TikTok, similarly introduced a diffusion language model called Seed Diffusion Preview in July, claiming five-fold speed improvements over comparable autoregressive architectures. These parallel efforts suggest industry-wide interest in alternative model paradigms that might offer efficiency advantages.\\nHowever, the practical adoption trajectory for diffusion language models remains uncertain. Autoregressive systems continue dominating commercial deployments due to proven performance in natural language understanding and generation\u2014the core requirements for customer-facing applications.\\nOpen-source strategy as market positioning\\nBy making the trillion-parameter AI model publicly available alongside the dInfer framework, Ant Group is pursuing a collaborative development model that contrasts with the closed approaches of some competitors.\xa0\\nThis strategy potentially accelerates innovation while positioning Ant\u2019s technologies as foundational infrastructure for the broader AI community.\\nThe company is simultaneously developing AWorld, a framework intended to support continual learning in autonomous AI agents\u2014systems designed to complete tasks independently on behalf of users.\\nWhether these combined efforts can establish Ant Group as a significant force in global AI development depends partly on real-world validation of the performance claims and partly on adoption rates among developers seeking alternatives to established platforms.\xa0\\nThe trillion-parameter AI model\u2019s open-source nature may facilitate this validation process while building a community of users invested in the technology\u2019s success.\\nFor now, the releases demonstrate that major Chinese technology firms view the current AI landscape as fluid enough to accommodate new entrants willing to innovate across multiple dimensions simultaneously.\\nSee also: Ant Group uses domestic chips to train AI models and cut costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

That wait period is often filled with worry and it always feels like an eternity. But what if that wait could be cut from weeks down to just a few minutes?\\nIn the next phase of its \u2018AI Airlock\u2019 programme, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is evaluating seven new technologies designed to tackle some of healthcare\u2019s most pressing challenges.\\nThe innovations being trialled could slash the time for bowel cancer test results to mere minutes and enable earlier detection of skin cancer and genetic eye diseases. The AI Airlock initiative provides a secure, controlled environment for manufacturers to test these sophisticated systems. This \u201cregulatory sandbox\u201d allows for evaluation of the AI\u2019s effectiveness and limitations, helping to forge a clear path towards eventual regulatory approval and deployment within the health service.\\nThe insights gained from this real-world testing will directly inform the MHRA\u2019s future regulations for AI as a medical device and feed into the National Commission into the Regulation of AI in Healthcare. This commission brings together a diverse group of patient advocates, clinicians, regulators, and technology companies to advise the agency.\\nThe seven selected technologies include AI-powered clinical note-taking to reduce administrative burdens on doctors, advanced cancer diagnostics, sophisticated eye disease detection, and tools that can summarise a patient\u2019s entire hospital stay or interpret complex blood tests. The ultimate goal is to use AI to support clinicians, helping them to make faster and better-informed care decisions for their patients.\\nHealth Innovation Minister Zubir Ahmed said: \u201cThe AI airlock programme is a great example of how we can test new innovations thoroughly while still moving at pace, as we seek to deliver on our promise to shift healthcare from analogue to digital.\xa0\\n\u201cThrough our ten year health plan we will drive for the NHS to be the most AI-enabled healthcare system in the world.\u201d\xa0\\nPioneering a path for safe AI healthcare innovation\\nThe evolution of AI presents unique challenges for regulators tasked with ensuring patient care safety.\xa0\\nLawrence Tallon, MHRA Chief Executive, commented: \u201cAs the first country to create a dedicated regulatory environment, or \u2018sandbox\u2019, specifically for AI medical devices, we\u2019re pioneering solutions to the unique challenges of regulating these emerging healthcare technologies.\xa0\xa0\xa0\\n\u201cThe first phase of AI Airlock demonstrated the value of close collaboration between innovators and regulators. I look forward to seeing the results of this new cohort and how their technologies will shape the next generation of safe, effective AI tools in healthcare.\u201d\xa0\\nThis second phase builds upon the success of the initial pilot. The MHRA has published four reports detailing the key findings from the first group of participants, which included innovative companies like Philips and OncoFlow.\\nWorking with the initial cohort, the AI Airlock programme identified several areas for regulatory improvement. These included better methods for validating synthetic data used to train AI models, ensuring the decisions made by an AI are \u201cexplainable\u201d to a clinician, and developing novel approaches to tackle emerging risks such as AI \u201challucinations,\u201d where a model generates incorrect or nonsensical information.\\nYinnon Dolev, Gen AI Product Owner at Philips Medical Systems, said: \u201cParticipating in the AI Airlock sandbox was a very positive experience.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project.

Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool. Instead of hiring consultants to spend months analyzing code, you can use AI to:\\nExtract business logic from legacy files.\\nDocument everything in markdown for human review.\\nAutomatically identify call chains and dependencies.\\nClean up irrelevant comments and historical logs.\\nAdd additional information as comments where needed.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Always have human experts review AI-generated analysis.

Even if you\u2019ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they\u2019re predictable. Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL\u2019s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.\\nDocumentation as source of truth: Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference.

This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents.

It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt. It\u2019s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.\\nThe traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that\u2019s unmaintainable. I\u2019ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don\u2019t understand in a language they\u2019re still learning.\\nThe AI-powered approach changes this. You use AI to understand business logic, generate human-readable modern code, and maintain control of your intellectual property. Your team stays involved throughout the process. They learn the business logic as they go. The code that comes out the other end is something your developers can actually work with.\\nJulia explained the shift:\\nWhat a lot of customers do not want to actually give all their intellectual property like a hundred percent to a partner anymore, right? They want to keep it in check.\\nStart here: your path to becoming the modernization hero\\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with COBOL, ancient Java, or any legacy system, here\u2019s how you can start today:\\nStart small\\nIdentify one problematic legacy system (start with fewer than 5,000 lines)\\nUse GitHub Copilot to analyze a single file\\nDocument what you discover in markdown\\nShare findings with your team\\nBuild your AI toolkit\\nExperiment with the Azure Samples framework\\nLearn prompt engineering for code analysis (try: \u201cAnalyze this COBOL program and explain its business purpose in simple terms\u201d)\\nPractice iterative modernization techniques\\nThink beyond code\\nConsider nonfunctional requirements for cloud-native design\\nPlan for distributed systems architecture\\nRemember: most COBOL programs are doing simple CRUD operations. They don\u2019t need the complexity of a mainframe. They need the simplicity of modern architecture.\\nHere\u2019s a challenge: Find a legacy system in your organization. Six-month-old code counts as legacy in our industry. Try using GitHub Copilot to:\\nGenerate business logic documentation\\nIdentify potential modernization opportunities\\nCreate a migration plan with human validation checkpoints\\nShare your results on LinkedIn and tag me. I\u2019d love to see what you discover.\\nThe best time to start is now\\nThe most powerful insight from my conversation with Julia is this: AI doesn\u2019t replace developer expertise. It amplifies it.\\nCOBOL experts bring irreplaceable domain knowledge. Modern developers bring fresh perspectives on architecture and best practices. AI brings pattern recognition and translation capabilities at scale.\\nWhen these three forces work together, legacy modernization transforms from an impossible challenge into an achievable project.\\nThe best time to modernize legacy code was 10 years ago. The second-best time is now.\\nSpecial thanks to Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who shared her insights and experiences that made this blog post possible.\\nReady to dive deeper? Check out the full blog post about this project at aka.ms/cobol-blog and connect with Julia on LinkedIn for the latest updates.\\nThe age of legacy code doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier anymore. With the right AI tools and framework, even 65-year-old COBOL can become approachable, maintainable, and modern.\\nWhat legacy system will you modernize next?

Check your environment</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After you know the lay of the land, the next question is: can you actually build it? Normally, you&rsquo;d spend time hunting for dependencies and making sure you&rsquo;ve installed the right versions. Copilot now handles that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You say:</strong> <em>Make sure my environment is ready to build this project.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot verifies dependencies, installs missing tools (like Go for the GitHub CLI), and confirms you can build locally.

Normally, after finding an issue to work on, you&rsquo;d create a branch, open the right files, make edits, and double-check your changes before committing.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it&#8217;s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.</p>\\n<p>It remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department&#8217;s website, along with the message:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Need irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either&#8221;</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Throughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar&#8217;s alias &#8220;Brad&#8221; (a.k.a. &#8220;Brad_banned&#8221;) frequently advertised Star Chat&#8217;s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker&#8217;s presence on a victim machine:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,<br />\\nbypass firewalls and have reverse shell access.</p>\\n<p>This shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!</p>\\n<p>Kernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.<br />\\nThis can range to simple shells to Bootkits.</p>\\n<p>Bypass all major EDR&#8217;s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)<br />\\nPatch EDR&#8217;s scanning functionality so it&#8217;s rendered useless!</p>\\n<p>Once implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)<br />\\nDevelopment Experience of several years and in multiple APT Groups.</p>\\n<p>Be one step ahead of the game.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.\\nAt a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled Transport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.\\n\\nA court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity reported that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider ransom attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group.\\nThat story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group\u2019s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.\\nThe story also noted that Jubair\u2019s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair\u2019s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.\\nEARLY DAYS (2021-2022)\\nJubair is alleged to have been a core member of the LAPSUS$\xa0cybercrime group that\xa0broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including\xa0Microsoft,\xa0Nvidia,\xa0Okta,\xa0Rockstar Games,\xa0Samsung,\xa0T-Mobile, and\xa0Uber.\\nThat is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames Amtrak\xa0and\xa0Asyntax. In the middle of the gang\u2019s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\\nThe leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax\u2019s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:\\n\\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair\u2019s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\\n\\n\\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including \u201cEverlynn,\u201d who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d\xa0targeting the major social media and email providers.\\nIn these so-called \u201cfake EDR\u201d schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\\n\\nThe roster of the now-defunct \u201cInfinity Recursion\u201d hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder \u201cEverlynn\u201d has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as \u201cPeter\u201d became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair\u2019s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$\u2019s chat channel.\\n\\n\\nEARTHTOSTAR\\nProsecutors in New Jersey last week alleged Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, 0ktapus, and UNC3944, and that he used the nicknames EarthtoStar, Brad, Austin, and Austistic.\\nBeginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called Star Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nJubair allegedly used the handle \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.\\n\\nThe group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target\u2019s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim\u2019s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.\\nIn February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with \u201cTmo up!\u201d and \u201cTmo down!\u201d notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile\u2019s network.\\n\\nA redacted receipt from Star Chat\u2019s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.\\n\\nThe data showed that Star Chat \u2014 along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time \u2014 collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.\\n\\nThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.\\n\\nA review of EarthtoStar\u2019s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint shows this person also sold \u201cAT&T email resets\u201d and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:\\n\u201cOk people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says \u20182fa required\u2019 or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?\u201d\\n\\nNew Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022 that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer\u2019s Okta authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.\\nThe phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.\\nThat weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, Plex and Signal.\\n\\nA visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.\\n\\nDA, COMRADE\\nEarthtoStar\u2019s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel \u201cFrauwudchat\u201d:\\n\u201cHi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API\u2019s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.\u201d\\n\\nAt around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat \u2014 \u201cRocketAce\u201d and \u201cLopiu\u201d \u2014 introduced the group\u2019s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit, including:\\n-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;\\n\\nThe user \u201cLopiu\u201d on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.\\n\\nThese two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar\u2019s many aliases, posted to Exploit:\\nHello. I have access to a telecommunications company\u2019s citrix and vpn. I would like someone to help me break out of the system and potentially attack the domain controller so all logins can be extracted we can discuss payment and things leave your telegram in the comments or private message me ! Looking for someone with knowledge in citrix/privilege escalation\\n\\nOn Nov. 15, 2022, EarthtoStar posted to their Star Sanctuary Telegram channel that they were hiring malware developers with a minimum of three years of experience and the ability to develop rootkits, backdoors and malware loaders.\\n\u201cOptional: Endorsed by advanced APT Groups (e.g. Conti, Ryuk),\u201d the ad concluded, referencing two of Russia\u2019s most rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate operations. \u201cPart of a nation-state / ex-3l (3 letter-agency).\u201d\\n2023-PRESENT DAY\\nThe Telegram and Discord chat channels wherein Flowers and Jubair allegedly planned and executed their extortion attacks are part of a loose-knit network known as the Com, an English-speaking cybercrime community consisting mostly of individuals living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\\nMany of these Com chat servers have hundreds to thousands of members each, and some of the more interesting solicitations on these communities are job offers for in-person assignments and tasks that can be found if one searches for posts titled, \u201cIf you live near,\u201d or \u201cIRL job\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cin real life\u201d job.\\nThese \u201cviolence-as-a-service\u201d solicitations typically involve \u201cbrickings,\u201d where someone is hired to toss a brick through the window at a specified address. Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it\u2019s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.\\nIt remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department\u2019s website, along with the message:\\n\u201cNeed irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either\u201d\\n\\nThroughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar\u2019s alias \u201cBrad\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cBrad_banned\u201d) frequently advertised Star Chat\u2019s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker\u2019s presence on a victim machine:\\nWe can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,\\nThis shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!\\nKernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.\\nBypass all major EDR\u2019s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)\\nOnce implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)\\nBe one step ahead of the game. Prices start from $5,000+. Message @brad_banned to get a quote\\n\\nIn September 2023 , both MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment suffered ransomware attacks at the hands of a Russian ransomware affiliate program known as ALPHV and BlackCat. Caesars reportedly paid a $15 million ransom in that incident.\\nWithin hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they\u2019d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.\\nThe Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.\\nIn April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of \u201cThe Com Cast,\u201d a lengthy screed detailing Jubair\u2019s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years.

That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida man charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.\\nUrban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.\\n\\nNoah \u201cKingbob\u201d Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.\\n\\nA\xa0court transcript (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features.

In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/globalsumudflotilla/p/DOXEm8viAZO/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">official statement</a> said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/DGGN1956/posts/812698534423606?ref=embed_post\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">National Guard on Facebook</a> stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZqrkLCnSl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">video</a> showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat.

No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXaR_MiOZ_/?igsh=YjdnaTEybGNocW94\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">recorded</a> from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast &#8211; the highest point on the vessel &#8211; before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"551\\" height=\\"987\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Gaza-flotilla-higher-colour-reduction-gif.gif\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49793\\"/></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Screencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat.

He can be seen <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXL9KhjJaK/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">in a video</a> from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXMeRaiq9t/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">said</a> in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Duarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXSL3jClWD/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">available</a> open sources documenting this strike.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"915\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49774\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg 1080w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-300x254.jpg 300w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-768x651.jpg 768w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Burned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions.
