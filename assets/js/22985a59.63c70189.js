Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> &#8212; the biggest attack that <strong>Google</strong> had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p>\\n<p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote <strong>Roland Dobbins</strong>, principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>, in a recent <a href=\\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p>\\n<p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;<strong>residential proxy</strong>&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-31323\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"631\\" height=\\"264\\" /></p>\\n<p>From a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>\\n<p>And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH</h2>\\n<p><strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> is co-founder of <a href=\\"https://spur.us\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:</p>\\n<p>AUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097<br />\\nRAYOBYTE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 43,894<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa043,008<br />\\nWEBSHARE_PROXY\xa0 \xa039,800<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 32,723<br />\\nPROXYCHEAP_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,368<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,202<br />\\nMYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY\xa0 25,287<br />\\nHYPE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 18,185<br />\\nMASSIVE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 17,152</p>\\n<p>Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;</p>\\n<p>LUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421<br />\\nNETNUT_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 10,982,458<br />\\nABCPROXY_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 9,294,419<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa06,754,790<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa03,209,313<br />\\nEARNFM_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,659,913<br />\\nNODEMAVEN_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,627,851<br />\\nINFATICA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,335,194<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,032,027<br />\\nYILU_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 1,549,155<span id=\\"more-72424\\"></span></p>\\n<p>Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bright Data</strong> was formerly known as <strong>Luminati Networks</strong>, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said <strong>Rony Shalit</strong>, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and <a href=\\"https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a robust opt-in only residential peers</a>, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>HK NETWORK</h2>\\n<p>Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.</p>\\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\\"https://synthient.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Synthient</a>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own <strong>software development kit</strong> or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is <em>forced to install</em> some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p>\\n<p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.</p>\\n<p>Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy service is <strong>IPidea</strong>, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include <strong>ABCProxy </strong>(#3), <strong>Roxlabs</strong>, <strong>LunaProxy</strong>, <strong>PIA S5 Proxy</strong>, <strong>PyProxy</strong>, <strong>922Proxy</strong>, <strong>360Proxy</strong>, <strong>IP2World</strong>, and <strong>Cherry Proxy.\xa0</strong>Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said they also track <strong>Yilu Proxy\xa0</strong>(#10) as IPidea.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &#8220;<strong>HK Network</strong>.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The way it works is there&#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'&#8221; Brundage explained. &#8220;But they&#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72441\\" style=\\"width: 760px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72441\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"517\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png 1126w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-768x529.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-782x539.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-100x70.png 100w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\" /></a><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies.

In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-deep-dive-into-the-residential-proxy-service-911/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China</a>. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/911-proxy-service-implodes-after-disclosing-breach/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the company&#8217;s servers were massively hacked</a>.</p>\\n<p>That 2022 story named <strong>Yunhe Wang</strong> from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">arrested Mr Wang</a>, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72454\\" style=\\"width: 759px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72454\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72454\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"494\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png 1182w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy-768x507.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy-782x516.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72454\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">The website for 922Proxy.</p></div>\\n<h2>DATA SCRAPING FOR AI</h2>\\n<p>In recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p>\\n<p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqleft\\">&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said.</span> &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p>\\n<p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">report</a> earlier this year from <strong>LibreNews</strong> found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">pay-per-crawl</a>&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p>\\n<p>On October 22, the social media and news network <strong>Reddit</strong> <a href=\\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Denas Grybauskas</strong>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p>\\n<p>In July, Google filed <a href=\\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME</h2>\\n<p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name <strong>fuckbriankrebs[.]com</strong>. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; and was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>\\n<p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72457\\" style=\\"width: 745px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72457 \\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"735\\" height=\\"707\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.\\n\\nFirst identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru\u2019s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.\\nIn June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second \u2014 the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru\u2019s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second \u2014 well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.\\nThese digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.\\n\u201cMultiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. \u201cOutbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.\u201d\\nThe incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru\u2019s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world\u2019s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.\\nExperts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else\u2019s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.\\n\\nFrom a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.\\nAnd as we\u2019ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.\\n\u2018INSANE\u2019 GROWTH\\nRiley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months \u2014 with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.\\n\u201cI just checked, and in the last 90 days we\u2019ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cThat is insane. That is so high of a number, it\u2019s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.\u201d\\nTo put Kilmer\u2019s comments in perspective, here was Spur\u2019s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:\\nAUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097\\nToday, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;\\nLUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421\\n\\nReached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur\u2019s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\\nBright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur\u2019s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur\u2019s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.\\n\u201cWe did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data\u2019s in some way,\u201d said Rony Shalit, Bright Data\u2019s chief compliance and ethics officer. \u201cIn many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.\u201d\\n\u201cOur network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,\u201d Shalit continued. \u201cEvery DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.\u201d\\nHK NETWORK\\nEven Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.\\nBenjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it\u2019s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What\u2019s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.\\nBrundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user\u2019s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.\\n\u201cProxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.\u201d\\nMany SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.\\nDepending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time \u2014 all maintained through other means, Brundage said.\\n\u201cOften, you\u2019ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.\u201d\\nSome proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider\u2019s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he\u2019d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.\\nBrundage says that by almost any measurement, the world\u2019s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur\u2019s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.\xa0Spur\u2019s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy\xa0(#10) as IPidea.\\nBrundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as \u201cHK Network.\u201d\\n\u201cThe way it works is there\u2019s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, \u2018Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we\u2019ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'\u201d Brundage explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.\u201d\\n\\nA graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.\\n\\nThose apps include a range of low-cost and \u201cfree\u201d virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user\u2019s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.\\n\u201cThey have all this bandwidth to offload,\u201d Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. \u201cAnd they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.\u201d\\nOne of IPidea\u2019s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy\u2019s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company\u2019s servers were massively hacked.\\nThat 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.\\n\\nThe website for 922Proxy.\\n\\nDATA SCRAPING FOR AI\\nIn recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That\u2019s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to block, because there\u2019s a risk of blocking real people,\u201d Spur\u2019s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.\\nKilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.\\n\u201cWeb crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cEverybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.\u201d\\nKilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.\\n\u201cWhere the cost of data is out of reach \u2014 there is some exclusivity or reason they can\u2019t access the data \u2014 they\u2019ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,\u201d Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.\\nAggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.\\nCloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company\u2019s \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.\\nOn October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.\\n\u201cRecognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThey do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.\u201d\\nDenas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.\\n\u201cReddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,\u201d Grybauskas said in a written statement. \u201cOxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.\u201d\\nAs big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.\\nIn July, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet\u2019s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet \u201ccompromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android\u2019s open-source software, which lacks Google\u2019s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.\u201d\\nA FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME\\nBrundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate \u201cscrew you\u201d to this site\u2019s author: One of the botnet\u2019s alleged partners goes by the handle \u201cForky,\u201d and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nBrundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru\u2019s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a \u201ckill switch\u201d capable of disrupting the botnet\u2019s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.\\n\\nA tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain.

Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d for the security intelligence company Seralys.\\nCaturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.\\nBut even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said.

Rather than bolt KEM onto the existing double ratchet, they allowed it to remain more or less the same as it had been. Then they used the new quantum-safe ratchet to implement a parallel secure messaging system.\\nNow, when the protocol encrypts a message, it sources encryption keys from both the classic Double Ratchet and the new ratchet. It then mixes the two keys together (using a cryptographic key derivation function) to get a new encryption key that has all of the security of the classical Double Ratchet but now has quantum security, too.\\n The Signal engineers have given this third ratchet the formal name: Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR for short. The third ratchet was designed in collaboration with PQShield, AIST, and New York University. The developers presented the erasure-code-based chunking and the high-level Triple Ratchet design at the Eurocrypt 2025 conference. At the Usenix 25 conference, they discussed the six options they considered for adding quantum-safe forward secrecy and post-compromise security and why SPQR and one other stood out. Presentations at the NIST PQC Standardization Conference and the Cryptographic Applications Workshop explain the details of chunking, the design challenges, and how the protocol had to be adapted to use the standardized ML-KEM.\\nJacomme further observed: \\nThe final thing interesting for the triple ratchet is that it nicely combines the best of both worlds. Between two users, you have a classical DH-based ratchet going on one side, and fully independently, a KEM-based ratchet is going on. Then, whenever you need to encrypt something, you get a key from both, and mix it up to get the actual encryption key. So, even if one ratchet is fully broken, be it because there is now a quantum computer, or because somebody manages to break either elliptic curves or ML-KEM, or because the implementation of one is flawed, or\u2026, the Signal message will still be protected by the second ratchet. In a sense, this update can be seen, of course simplifying, as doubling the security of the ratchet part of Signal, and is a cool thing even for people that don\u2019t care about quantum computers.\\n\\n\\nAlso read this post on X.","id":"https://www.schneier.com/?p=71097","isoDate":"2025-10-29T11:09:57.000Z","feedKey":"schneier-security","feedTitle":"Schneier on Security","category":"cyber","cleanTitle":"Signal\u2019s Post-Quantum Cryptographic Implementation","publishedDate":"2025-10-29T11:09:57.000Z"},{"title":"Social Engineering People\u2019s Credit Card Details","link":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/social-engineering-peoples-credit-card-details.html","pubDate":"2025-10-28T11:01:20.000Z","author":"Unknown","content":"<p>Good <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href=\\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/url-scam-texts-china-gangs-68e96097?st=XcjCtr&#038;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&#038;utm_source=substack&#038;utm_medium=email\\">article</a> on criminal gangs that scam people out of their credit card information:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Your highway toll payment is now past due, one text warns.

With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

Instead, it was anchored off the Port of Alexandria, Egypt \u2013 another known location for offloading grain from occupied Ukraine, according to OCCRP reporting.\\n\u201cGrain Theft\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine has repeatedly tried to dissuade countries from purchasing shipments loaded with what it describes as stolen grain from occupied regions.\xa0\\nThe Port of Sevastopol and the Avlita grain terminal remain under European, UK and US sanctions. While no UN sanctions specifically target the port, a majority of UN member states have passed resolutions condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and of its occupation of Crimea since 2024.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Irtysh and Matros Pozynich delivered grain to the Houti-controlled Port of Saleef via Djibouti \u2013 the UNVIM inspection point for Yemen. After ten years of war, the UNHCR reports that tens of thousands of people in Yemen are living in famine-like conditions, with a further five million people experiencing food insecurity.\\nUNVIM confirmed to Bellingcat that the Irtysh was inspected \u201cin line with UNVIM operational protocols\u201d on Sept. 7 and cleared by the Saudi-led coalition Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Cell (EHOC) \u2013 a body entirely separate from the UN \u2013 on Sept. 8.\\nAsked whether UNVIM was aware the vessel had picked up grain from a port under Western sanctions, the agency replied: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-bellingcat-donate-block\\"><div><div class=\\"wp-block-image alignleft\\">\\n<figure class=\\"is-resized\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/05/question-mark.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"27\\" height=\\"27\\"/></div></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Support Bellingcat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\\">\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-button\\"><a class=\\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\\" href=\\"https://bellingcat.com/donate?utm_campaign=article_cta\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Donate</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Denis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">poisoned</a> by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak. Source: intelx.io. Below: Facebook data leak in Bellingcat\u2019s database.\\nPeople using Numbuster and GetContact, meanwhile, tagged the same phone number as belonging to Milchakov.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth screenshots depict Numbuster results for Milchakov\u2019s phone number ending in 386. Tags include his famous nickname \u201cSerb\u201d, but also \u201cAlexey Yuryevich\u201d (his name and patronymic) and \u201cSerb Milchakov Alexey\u201d.\\nContact book apps like these harvest data from users\u2019 phones and have been used in many investigations, such as Bellingcat\u2019s Berlin Tiergarten assassination investigation (where Numbuster and GetContact were used) and the investigation into the death of Colombian protestor, Lucas Villa (where TrueCaller was used).\\nIn Numbuster, one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers (ending in 663 and that he used for his Yandex Food account) is tagged as \u201cVlad United Russia St. Petersburg Youth Politics\u201d.\\n\\nThe first two entries list Romanov\u2019s name as Vladislav Gillung.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage. NASA FIRMS continued to detect active fires in Etosha up until Oct. 5. \\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

Source: Facebook, TV Paju\xe7ara / YouTube\\nAn Australian pilot who recently died when his small plane crashed in South America during a failed drug run has links to an alleged Kinahan cartel associate who is facing charges over the importation of a multimillion dollar cocaine shipment to Western Australia.\\nThe body of former Melbourne stockbroker Timothy James Clark was reportedly found at the wreckage of his single-engine Sling 4 in Brazil\u2019s north-east on September 14, along with about 200kg of cocaine. \\n\\nLeft: the wreckage of the small aircraft in a sugarcane field in Coruripe; Timothy Clark\u2019s drivers licence. Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann. Top left: The Overlander Airport, where he allegedly met an aircraft on Dec 27, 2024. Bottom left: cocaine seized by the AFP. Right: Herrmann after he was detained. Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region. Source: Flightradar24, Facebook, Google Earth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sunday Times reports today that the Sling 4 kit-plane piloted by Clark had been heavily modified for transatlantic flights. A source told the newspaper that Clark replaced the engine at least once in Brazil, indicating he was continuously flying it long-haul, and may have fitted a third engine due to the number of flying hours he was accumulating.\xa0\\nClark\u2019s plane crashed about an 11-hour flight from the Amazon basin, a region that has become a major trafficking route for cocaine bound for Europe, the drug\u2019s fastest-expanding market.\xa0\\n\\nThe wreckage of Clark\u2019s plane, which crashed earlier this month in Coruripe on the southern coast of the Brazilian state of Alagoas. Source: TV Paju\xe7ara / YouTube\\nTonnes of the drug flow from neighbouring Peru and Colombia, moving through the Amazon before being shipped to Europe and Africa.\\nThe Sunday Times said Clark and Herrmann\u2019s alleged activities suggested the Kinahan cartel had opened new smuggling routes for smaller shipments following a succession of seizures of cocaine consignments by police forces across Europe.\xa0\\nOliver Herrmann, who has no known convictions, has not yet entered a plea. His case is listed for a committal mention in Perth Magistrates Court on October 10.\\nPeter Barth, Connor Plunkett, Beau Donelly and John Mooney contributed to this article.\\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

Thailand already has an active creative scene, and this launch is meant to support more visual storytelling from the region. The app&#8217;s rollout also includes Vietnam and Taiwan.</p>\\n<p>Sora first arrived in the US and Canada in early September, and many users there have already shared clips. The app has since passed one million downloads in under five days, according to a social media post by Sora head Bill Peebles, who noted that it reached that milestone even faster than ChatGPT did at launch, despite requiring users to be invited to use the app at launch.</p>\\n<p>People in Thailand can download the app for free on iOS with no invite code. For now, use limits are relatively generous, though those limits may change.</p>\\n<p>The app is powered by Sora 2, a video generation model that can produce &#8216;original&#8217; clips, remix existing creations, and suggest content through a personal feed. Users can also appear directly inside scenes through a feature called Cameos, which requires a one-time check to confirm identity and likeness. The app supports Thai language input.</p>\\n<p>Cameos have quickly become a popular feature among early testers as they offer a playful way to interact and connect with friends. Thai creator Woody Milintachinda said, &#8220;Sora allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that immediately resonates with audiences. They can see and feel the story unfold. It has also given me a unique platform to share my experiences with a wide community of creators and storytellers not just in Thailand but the world, inspiring new forms of connection and creativity. With Sora, the creative possibilities truly feel limitless.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To go with this release, the app now includes Character Cameos, with which users can turn nearly anything into a reusable character, such as a pet, drawing, personal item, or original design created inside Sora. After uploading a video of the character, users can assign permissions that are separate from their personal likeness. That character can stay private, be shared only with followers, or be opened to everyone on the platform.

Thailand already has an active creative scene, and this launch is meant to support more visual storytelling from the region. The app\u2019s rollout also includes Vietnam and Taiwan.\\nSora first arrived in the US and Canada in early September, and many users there have already shared clips. The app has since passed one million downloads in under five days, according to a social media post by Sora head Bill Peebles, who noted that it reached that milestone even faster than ChatGPT did at launch, despite requiring users to be invited to use the app at launch.\\nPeople in Thailand can download the app for free on iOS with no invite code. For now, use limits are relatively generous, though those limits may change.\\nThe app is powered by Sora 2, a video generation model that can produce \u2018original\u2019 clips, remix existing creations, and suggest content through a personal feed. Users can also appear directly inside scenes through a feature called Cameos, which requires a one-time check to confirm identity and likeness. The app supports Thai language input.\\nCameos have quickly become a popular feature among early testers as they offer a playful way to interact and connect with friends. Thai creator Woody Milintachinda said, \u201cSora allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that immediately resonates with audiences. They can see and feel the story unfold. It has also given me a unique platform to share my experiences with a wide community of creators and storytellers not just in Thailand but the world, inspiring new forms of connection and creativity. With Sora, the creative possibilities truly feel limitless.\u201d\\nTo go with this release, the app now includes Character Cameos, with which users can turn nearly anything into a reusable character, such as a pet, drawing, personal item, or original design created inside Sora. After uploading a video of the character, users can assign permissions that are separate from their personal likeness. That character can stay private, be shared only with followers, or be opened to everyone on the platform. Once named, the character can appear in any future video.\\nTo mark the Halloween season, the app launches with a starter pack that includes classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein\u2019s monster, Ghost, Witch, and Jack-O-Lantern.\\nThe company says it plans to bring Sora to Thailand with responsibility in mind.

Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor recovery reflects calculated strategic pivots made during its downturn, market dynamics that finally shifted in its favour, and intense competitive pressures that forced the company to accelerate its AI chip roadmap.</p>\\n<h3>The road back from the slump</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s journey to this quarter&#8217;s performance began in a different place. Throughout 2024 and into early 2025, the company faced multiple headwinds: a brutal memory chip glut that collapsed prices, delayed qualification of its HBM products with key customers, and the company seeing rival SK Hynix capture early leadership in AI memory chips.</p>\\n<p>The low point came in the second quarter of 2025, when Samsung&#8217;s chip division reported operating profit that had analysts questioning whether the company had lost its technological edge. SK Hynix had seized the top spot in the memory market for the first time, fueled by its early success supplying HBM chips to Nvidia&#8217;s AI accelerators.</p>\\n<p>MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, <a href=\\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/samsumg-reclaims-global-memory-market-top-spot-in-Q3-2025-driven-by-robust-dram-nand-demand\\">contextualised</a> Samsung&#8217;s third-quarter performance as &#8220;a clear result of a broader memory market boom and rising prices for general-purpose memory.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>But Hwang&#8217;s firm also noted that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market from SK Hynix during Q3, suggesting the semiconductor recovery involved more than just favourable market conditions.</p>\\n<h3>HBM: From laggard to mass production</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s ability to reverse its HBM fortunes proved central to the turnaround. The company confirmed that HBM3E is now &#8220;in mass production and being sold to all related customers,&#8221; while HBM4 samples are &#8220;simultaneously being shipped to key clients.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Reports emerged in late September that Samsung had passed Nvidia&#8217;s qualification tests for advanced high-bandwidth memory chips \u2013 a important milestone that had eluded the company for months.

Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>That supply-demand imbalance has created pricing power that Samsung lacked during its declining quarters. The company specifically cited &#8220;a favourable price environment&#8221; and &#8220;notably reduced one-off costs like inventory value adjustments&#8221; as contributors to higher profits.</p>\\n<h3>Beyond memory: Foundry progress and challenges</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor recovery extended beyond memory chips. The Foundry Business, which manufactures chips designed by other companies, &#8220;posted a significant improvement in earnings in Q3 2025, stemming from a reduction in one-off costs and better fab use.&#8221; The division also achieved &#8220;record-high customer orders, mainly on advanced nodes.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The foundry business is ramping up mass production of 2-nanometer Gate-All-Around (GAA) products, an important technology that helps maintain competitiveness against TSMC, the company that dominates the foundry market. Samsung indicated it would begin operations at its fab in Taylor, Texas, &#8220;in a timely manner&#8221; in 2026.</p>\\n<p>However, the System LSI Business, which designs Samsung&#8217;s Exynos processors and image sensors, saw earnings stall &#8220;due to seasonality and customer inventory adjustments.&#8221;</p>\\n<h3>What this means for 2026</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s guidance for the coming year reflects confidence that the semiconductor recovery has staying power. The Memory Business will &#8220;focus on the mass production of HBM4 products with differentiated performance&#8221; while aiming to &#8220;scale out the HBM sales base.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The company plans capacity expansion in its 1c manufacturing process to meet projected HBM4 demand increases. Consolidated revenue for the quarter reached KRW 86.1 trillion, a 15.4% increase from the previous quarter and 8.85% higher year-over-year. The Device eXperience division, which includes smartphones, contributed KRW 34.1 trillion in revenue, supported by the Galaxy Z Fold7 launch and strong flagship sales.</p>\\n<p>Yet challenges persist. Samsung Display reported solid performance with KRW 8.1 trillion in revenue and KRW 1.2 trillion in operating profit, but the Visual Display business recorded an operating loss of KRW 0.1 trillion despite &#8220;solid sales growth of premium products,&#8221; citing &#8220;intensified competition.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The semiconductor recovery that Samsung achieved in Q3 2025 resolves the immediate crisis that threatened its market position.

href=\\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro\\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)</a> is a simple, common way for AI models (LLMs) to talk to APIs and data. Think of it like a universal plug: if both sides support MCP, they can connect and work together. An MCP server is any service or app that &ldquo;speaks MCP&rdquo; and offers tools the model can use, publishing a list of tools, what each tool does, and what inputs (parameters) each tool needs.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?utm_source=blog-github-mcp-server&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25post\\">The GitHub MCP Server</a> is the foundation for many <a href=\\"https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=blog-copilot-feature&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25post\\">GitHub Copilot</a> workflows, both inside and outside of GitHub. As an engineering team working on GitHub MCP, we&rsquo;re always looking to deliver new features and functionality, while avoiding regressions and improving quality with every iteration. And how we name a tool, explain what it does, and spell out its parameters directly affects whether the model picks the right tool, in the right order, with the right arguments.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to our work, small edits matter: tightening a description, adding or removing a tool, or combining a few similar tools can shift results a lot. When descriptions are off, agents choose the wrong tool, skip a step, send arguments in the wrong format, or drop them entirely. The outcome is weak. We need a safe way to change MCP and know if things actually got better, not worse. That&rsquo;s where offline evaluation comes in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Offline evaluation catches regressions before users see them and keeps the feedback loop short, so we can ship changes that genuinely improve performance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article walks through our evaluation pipeline and explains the metrics and algorithms that help us achieve these goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-automated-offline-evaluation-works\\">How automated offline evaluation works</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our offline evaluation pipeline checks how well our tool prompts work across different models. The tool instructions are kept simple and precise so the model can choose the right tool and fill in the correct parameters. Because LLMs vary in how they use tools, we systematically test each model&ndash;MCP pairing to measure compatibility, quality, and gaps.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-quick-intro-to-mcp-hosting\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Quick intro to MCP hosting</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MCP host or agent connects to one or more MCP servers, fetches their tool lists, and passes that info&mdash;along with the user&rsquo;s request&mdash;to the LLM.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How it works (step by step):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>The MCP server exposes tools (with names, descriptions, and required inputs).</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>The agent pulls that tool list and gives it to the model.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>When the user asks something, the LLM decides if it needs a tool.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>If yes, it picks a tool and fills in the inputs.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>The agent calls the tool on the MCP server and returns the result to the LLM, which then forms the final answer.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have curated datasets that we use as benchmarks.

Low recall may indicate that the model doesn&rsquo;t understand that the tool needs to be called and fails to call the tool or calls another tool instead.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>F1-score</strong> is a harmonic mean showing how well the model is doing in terms of both precision and recall.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If the model confuses two tools, it can result in low precision or recall for these tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have two similar tools that used to be confused often, which are <code>list_issues</code> and <code>search_issues</code>. Let&rsquo;s say we have 10 benchmarks for <code>list_issues</code>&nbsp; and 10 benchmarks for <code>search_issues</code>. Imagine <code>list_issues</code> is called correctly in all of 10 cases and on top in 30% of cases where search_issues should be called.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This means we&rsquo;re going to have lower recall for <code>search_issues</code> and lower precision for <code>list_issues</code>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Precision</strong> (<code>list_issues</code>) = 10 (cases where tool is called correctly) / (10 + 3 (cases where tool is called instead of <code>search_issues</code>)) = 0.77</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Recall</strong> (<code>search_issues</code>) =&nbsp; 7 (tool was called correctly) / 10 (cases where tool is expected to be called) = 0.7</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In order to have visibility into what tools are confused with each other, we build a confusion matrix. Confusion matrix for the <code>search_issues</code> and <code>list_issues</code> tools from the example above would look the following:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><thead><tr><th><strong>Expected tool / Called tool</strong></th><th><strong>search_issues</strong></th><th><strong>list_issues</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>search_issues</strong></td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>list_issues</strong></td><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The confusion matrix allows us to see the reason behind low precision and recall for certain tools and tweak their descriptions to minimize confusion.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"argument-correctness\\">Argument correctness</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Selecting the right tool isn&rsquo;t enough.

Think of it like a universal plug: if both sides support MCP, they can connect and work together. An MCP server is any service or app that \u201cspeaks MCP\u201d and offers tools the model can use, publishing a list of tools, what each tool does, and what inputs (parameters) each tool needs.\xa0\\nThe GitHub MCP Server is the foundation for many GitHub Copilot workflows, both inside and outside of GitHub. As an engineering team working on GitHub MCP, we\u2019re always looking to deliver new features and functionality, while avoiding regressions and improving quality with every iteration. And how we name a tool, explain what it does, and spell out its parameters directly affects whether the model picks the right tool, in the right order, with the right arguments.\xa0\\nWhen it comes to our work, small edits matter: tightening a description, adding or removing a tool, or combining a few similar tools can shift results a lot. When descriptions are off, agents choose the wrong tool, skip a step, send arguments in the wrong format, or drop them entirely. The outcome is weak. We need a safe way to change MCP and know if things actually got better, not worse. That\u2019s where offline evaluation comes in.\\nOffline evaluation catches regressions before users see them and keeps the feedback loop short, so we can ship changes that genuinely improve performance.\\nThis article walks through our evaluation pipeline and explains the metrics and algorithms that help us achieve these goals.\\nHow automated offline evaluation works\\nOur offline evaluation pipeline checks how well our tool prompts work across different models. The tool instructions are kept simple and precise so the model can choose the right tool and fill in the correct parameters. Because LLMs vary in how they use tools, we systematically test each model\u2013MCP pairing to measure compatibility, quality, and gaps.\\nQuick intro to MCP hosting\\nMCP host or agent connects to one or more MCP servers, fetches their tool lists, and passes that info\u2014along with the user\u2019s request\u2014to the LLM.\\nHow it works (step by step):\\nThe MCP server exposes tools (with names, descriptions, and required inputs).\\nThe agent pulls that tool list and gives it to the model.\\nWhen the user asks something, the LLM decides if it needs a tool.\\nIf yes, it picks a tool and fills in the inputs.\\nThe agent calls the tool on the MCP server and returns the result to the LLM, which then forms the final answer.\\nWe have curated datasets that we use as benchmarks. Every benchmark contains the following parameters:\xa0\\nInput: This is a user request formulated in natural language.\xa0\\nExpected tools: Tools we expect to be called.\\nExpected arguments: Arguments we expect to be passed to each tool.\\nHere are a few examples:\\nAsking how many issues were created in a given time period\\nInput:\xa0 How many issues were created in the github/github-mcp-server repository during April 2025?\xa0\\nExpected tools: list_issues with arguments:\\nowner: github \\nrepo: github-mcp-server \\nsince: 2025-04-01T00:00:00Z\\nMerging pull requests\\nInput: Merge PR 123 in github/docs using squash merge with title \u201cUpdate installation guide\u201d\\nExpected tools: merge_pull_request with arguments:\\nowner: github\\nrepo: docs \\npullNumber: 123 \\nmerge_method: squash \\ncommit_title: Update installation guide\\nRequesting code reviews\\nInput: Request reviews from alice456 and bob123 for PR 67 in team/project-alpha\\nExpected tools: update_pull_request with arguments:\xa0\\nowner: team \\nrepo: project-alpha \\npullNumber: 67\\nreviewers: [\\"alice456\\", \\"bob123\\"]\\nSummarizing discussion comments\\nInput: Summarize the comments in discussion 33801, in the facebook/react repository\xa0\\nExpected tools: get_discussion_comments with arguments:\\nowner: facebook\\nrepo: react\\ndiscussionNumber: 33801\\nThe evaluation pipeline has three stages: fulfillment, evaluation, and summarization.\\nFulfillment: We run each benchmark across multiple models, providing the list of available MCP tools with every request. For each run, we record which tools the model invoked and the arguments it supplied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation: We process the raw outputs and compute metrics and scores.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummarization: We aggregate dataset-level statistics and produce the final evaluation report.\\nEvaluation metrics and algorithms\\nOur evaluation targets two aspects: whether the model selects the correct tools and whether it supplies correct arguments.\\nTool selection\\nWhen benchmarks involve a single tool call, tool selection reduces to a multi-class classification problem. Each benchmark is labeled with the tool it expects, and each tool is a \u201cclass.\u201d\\nModels tasked with this classification are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\\nAccuracy is the simplest measure that shows the percentage of correct classifications. In our case it means the percentage of inputs that resulted in an expected tool call. This is calculated on the whole dataset.\\nPrecision shows the proportion of the cases for which the tool was called correctly out of all cases where the tool was called. Low precision means the model picks the tool even for the cases where the tool is not expected to be called.\\nRecall shows the proportion of correctly called tools out of all cases where the given tool call was expected. Low recall may indicate that the model doesn\u2019t understand that the tool needs to be called and fails to call the tool or calls another tool instead.\\nF1-score is a harmonic mean showing how well the model is doing in terms of both precision and recall.\xa0\\nIf the model confuses two tools, it can result in low precision or recall for these tools.\\nWe have two similar tools that used to be confused often, which are list_issues and search_issues. Let\u2019s say we have 10 benchmarks for list_issues\xa0 and 10 benchmarks for search_issues. Imagine list_issues is called correctly in all of 10 cases and on top in 30% of cases where search_issues should be called.\\nThis means we\u2019re going to have lower recall for search_issues and lower precision for list_issues:\\nPrecision (list_issues) = 10 (cases where tool is called correctly) / (10 + 3 (cases where tool is called instead of search_issues)) = 0.77\\nRecall (search_issues) =\xa0 7 (tool was called correctly) / 10 (cases where tool is expected to be called) = 0.7\\nIn order to have visibility into what tools are confused with each other, we build a confusion matrix. Confusion matrix for the search_issues and list_issues tools from the example above would look the following:\\n\\nExpected tool / Called toolsearch_issueslist_issues\\n\\nsearch_issues73\\nlist_issues010\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe confusion matrix allows us to see the reason behind low precision and recall for certain tools and tweak their descriptions to minimize confusion.\\nArgument correctness\\nSelecting the right tool isn\u2019t enough. The model must also supply correct arguments. We\u2019ve defined a set of argument-correctness metrics that pinpoint specific issues, making regressions easy to diagnose and fix.\\nWe track four argument-quality metrics:\\nArgument hallucination: How often the model supplies argument names that aren\u2019t defined for the tool.\\nAll expected arguments provided: Whether every expected argument is present.\\nAll required arguments provided: Whether all required arguments are included.\\nExact value match: Whether provided argument values match the expected values exactly.\\nThese metrics are computed for tools that were correctly selected. The final report summarizes each tool\u2019s performance across all four metrics.\\nLooking forward and filling the gaps\\nThe current evaluation framework gives us a solid read on tool performance against curated datasets, but there\u2019s still room to improve.\\nMore is better\\nBenchmark volume is the weak point of offline evaluation. With so many classes (tools), we need more robust per-tool coverage. Evaluations based on just a couple of examples aren\u2019t dependable alone. Adding more benchmarks is always useful to increase the reliability of classification evaluation and other metrics.\\nEvaluation of multi-tool flows\\nOur current pipeline handles only single tool calls. In practice, tools are often invoked sequentially, with later calls consuming the outputs of earlier ones. To evaluate these flows, we must go beyond fetching the MCP tool list and actually execute tool calls (or mock their responses) during evaluation.\\nWe\u2019ll also update summarization. Today we treat tool selection as multi-class classification, which assumes one tool per input. For flows where a single input can trigger multiple tools, multi-label classification is the better fit.\\nTake this with you\\nOffline evaluation gives us a fast, safe way to iterate on MCP, so models pick the right GitHub tools with the right arguments. By combining curated benchmarks with clear metrics\u2014classification scores for tool selection and targeted checks for argument quality\u2014we turn vague \u201cit seems better\u201d into measurable progress and actionable fixes.\\nWe\u2019re not stopping here. We\u2019re expanding benchmark coverage, refining tool descriptions to reduce confusion, and extending the pipeline to handle real multi-tool flows with execution or faithful mocks. These investments mean fewer regressions, clearer insights, and more reliable agents that help developers move faster.\\nMost importantly, this work raises the bar for product quality without slowing delivery. As we grow the suite and deepen the evaluation, you can expect steadier improvements to GitHub MCP Server\u2014and a better, more predictable experience for anyone building with it.\\n\\nThe post Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"Ksenia Bobrova","description":"<p>Take a look inside our automated pipeline for rapid, rigorous evaluation for the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/measuring-what-matters-how-offline-evaluation-of-github-mcp-server-works/\\">Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>Take a look inside our automated pipeline for rapid, rigorous evaluation for the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/measuring-what-matters-how-offline-evaluation-of-github-mcp-server-works/\\">Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"Take a look inside our automated pipeline for rapid, rigorous evaluation for the GitHub MCP Server.\\nThe post Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=92092","categories":["AI & ML","Generative AI","GitHub Copilot","MCP"],"isoDate":"2025-10-30T21:46:07.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works","publishedDate":"2025-10-30T21:46:07.000Z","author":"Ksenia Bobrova","summary":"Take a look inside our automated pipeline for rapid, rigorous evaluation for the GitHub MCP Server.\\nThe post Measuring what matters: How offline evaluation of GitHub MCP Server works appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Kyle Daigle","title":"Introducing Agent HQ: Any agent, any way you work","link":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:08:15 +0000","content:encoded":"\\n<p>The current AI landscape presents a challenge we\u2019re all too familiar with: incredible power fragmented across different tools and interfaces.

At GitHub, we\u2019ve always worked to solve these kinds of systemic challenges\u2014by making Git accessible, code review systematic with pull requests, and automating deployment with Actions.\xa0\\nWith 180 million developers, GitHub is growing at its fastest rate ever\u2014a new developer joining every second. What\u2019s more, 80% of new developers are using Copilot in their first week. AI isn\u2019t just a tool anymore; it\u2019s an integral part of the development experience. Our responsibility is to ensure this new era of collaboration is powerful, secure, and seamlessly integrated into the workflow you already trust.\\nAt GitHub Universe, we\u2019re announcing Agent HQ, GitHub\u2019s vision for the next evolution of our platform. Agents shouldn\u2019t be bolted on. They should work the way you already work. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making agents native to the GitHub flow.\\nAgent HQ transforms GitHub into an open ecosystem that unites every agent on a single platform. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, xAI, and more will become available directly within GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo bring this vision to life, we\u2019re shipping a suite of new capabilities built on the primitives you trust. This starts with a mission control, a single command center to assign, steer, and track the work of multiple agents from anywhere. It extends to VS Code with new ways to plan and customize agent behavior. And it is backed by enterprise-grade functionality: a new generation of agentic code review, a dedicated control plane to govern AI access and agent behavior, and a metrics dashboard to understand the impact of AI on your work.\xa0\\nWe are also deeply committed to investing in our platform and strengthening the primitives you rely on every day. This new world of development is powered by that foundational work, and we look forward to sharing more updates.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s dive in.\\nIn this post\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nIncreased confidence and control for your team\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\xa0\xa0\\nThe future is about giving you the power to orchestrate a fleet of specialized agents to perform complex tasks in parallel, not juggling a patchwork of disconnected tools or relying on a single agent. As the pioneer of asynchronous collaboration, we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to make sure these next-generation async tools just work.\xa0\\nWith Agent HQ what\u2019s not changing is just as important as what is. You\u2019re still working with the primitives you know\u2014Git, pull requests, issues\u2014and using your preferred compute, whether that\u2019s GitHub Actions or self-hosted runners. You\u2019re accessing agents through your existing paid Copilot subscription.\xa0\\nOn top of that foundation, we\u2019re opening the doors to a new world of capability. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI will be available on GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\nDon\u2019t want to wait? Starting this week, Copilot Pro+ users can begin working with \xa0OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders, the first of our partner agents to extend beyond its native surfaces and directly into the editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nThe power of Agent HQ comes from mission control, a unified command center that follows you wherever you work. It\u2019s not a single destination; it\u2019s a consistent interface across GitHub, VS Code, mobile, and the CLI that lets you direct, monitor, and manage every AI-driven task. With mission control, you can choose from a fleet of agents, assign them work in parallel, and track their progress from any device.\xa0\\nWe\u2019re also providing:\xa0\\nNew branch controls that give you granular oversight over when to run CI and other checks for agent-created code.\\nIdentity features to control which agent is building the task, managing access, and policies just like you would with any other developer on your team.\\nOne-click merge conflict resolution, improved file navigation, and better code commenting capabilities.\\nNew integrations for Slack and Linear, on top of our recently announced connections for Atlassian Jira, Microsoft Teams and Azure Boards, and Raycast.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTry mission control today.\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nMission control is in VS Code, too, so you\u2019ve got a single view of all your agents running in VS Code, in the Copilot CLI, or on GitHub.\\nToday\u2019s brand new release in VS Code is all about working alongside agents on projects, and it\u2019s not surprising that great results start with a great plan. Getting the context right before a project is critical, but that same context needs to carry through into the work. Copilot already adapts to the way your team works by learning from your files and your project\u2019s culture, but sometimes you need more pointed context.\\nSo today, we\u2019re introducing Plan Mode, which works with Copilot, and asks you clarifying questions along the way, to help you to build a step-by-step approach for your task. Providing the context upfront improves what Copilot can do and helps you find gaps, missing decisions, or project deficiencies early in the process\u2014before any code is written. Once you approve, your plan goes to Copilot to start implementing, whether that\u2019s locally in VS Code or using an agent in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor even finer control, you can now create custom agents in VS Code with AGENTS.md files, source-controlled documents that let you set clear rules and guardrails such as \u201cprefer this logger\u201d or \u201cuse table-driven tests for all handlers.\u201d This shapes Copilot\u2019s behavior without you re-prompting it every time.\\nNow you can rely on the new GitHub MCP Registry, available directly in VS Code.

Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub</strong>. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>AI is reshaping choices, not just code. </strong>In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that&rsquo;s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And one of the biggest things in 2025? <strong>Agents are here.</strong> Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we&rsquo;re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128161; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a visual learner, we have you covered.&#128071;</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\"><div class=\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\">\\n<iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" title=\\"Octoverse 2025: AI, India, and the new #1 programming language\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"281\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-u6dUg6IJk?feature=oembed\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\\">The state&#8239;of&#8239;GitHub in&#8239;2025: A year of record growth</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1152\\" height=\\"288\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288\\" alt=\\"Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91477\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1152 1152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1024 1024w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million.

Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in <strong>151k+ repositories (+172% YoY).</strong> Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub&rsquo;s engineers <a href=\\"https://github.blog/security/web-application-security/inside-github-how-we-hardened-our-saml-implementation/\\">published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow</a>, which offers some valuable lessons).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"automation-is-working-until-the-merge-queue-stalls\\">Automation is working (until the merge queue stalls)</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Developers are automating more build, test, and security activity.</strong> In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free.

Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub\u2014over 36 million in the past year. It\u2019s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.\xa0\\nThe release of GitHub Copilot Free in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged 43.2 million pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)\u2014including a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\xa0\\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s data highlights three key shifts:\xa0\\nGenerative\u202fAI is now standard in development. More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug \u201825 vs. Aug \u201824). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn\u2019t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is reshaping choices, not just code. In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that\u2019s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? Agents are here. Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we\u2019re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s jump in.\\n\ud83d\udca1 Oh, and if you\u2019re a visual learner, we have you covered.\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state\u202fof\u202fGitHub in\u202f2025: A year of record growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\\nSo, what does \u201cmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average\u201d actually mean?\xa0\\nDevelopers are converging on GitHub. More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\xa0\\nAI adoption starts immediately. We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use GitHub Copilot within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\xa0\\nThe talent boom is geographically diverse. Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\xa0\\nGitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of Copilot Free in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub\u2019s dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\\n\\n2025\u2011YTD lensContributionsShare of totalWhat it signals\\n\\nPrivate repositories4.97B\u2248\u202f81.5%Enterprise and team\u2011level collaboration is happening on GitHub.\xa0\\nPublic repositories1.12B\u2248\u202f18.5%The volume of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey numbers\\n180M+ developers are now on GitHub\\n630M total repositories with +121M new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\\n+58M private repositories (up \u202f33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\xa0\\nOpen source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub. 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\\nDeveloper productivity: shipping more, waiting less\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following the SPACE framework (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year\u2019s data.\\nDeveloper activity reached record levels in 2025\\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\\n\\nActivity2024 monthly average2025 monthly average\\n\\nIssues closed\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4M4.25M\\nPull requests merged\u202f35M43.2M\\nCode pushes65M82.19M\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the preview of Copilot coding agent in March and the introduction of Copilot code review in April. In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\xa0\\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\\nPull requests created: +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\\nIssues created: +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\\nComments on issues/PRs: essentially flat (+0.35%)\\nComments on commits: down -27% (sharp decline)\\nThese are observational signals rather than causal claims and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks and Dockerfiles highlight two stages of modern development\\nNotebooks are now a mature tool for experimentation, while Dockerfiles are considered the bridge to reproducibility and production. In 2025, 2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY) and 1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY). This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\\n\\nRepositories in\u202f2024Repositories in\u202f2025Delta\\n\\nJupyter Notebook present\u202f1.4M2.42M\xa0+75%\\nDockerfile present\u202f875k1.9M+120%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents enter the mainstream\\nAI code\u202freview helps developers.

Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\xa0\\nWhat about vibe coding?\xa0\\nOne notable trend in 2025 was \u201cvibe coding.\u201d First coined by Andrej Karparthy, vibe coding emerged as shorthand for a developer workflow that starts with an idea and jumps straight to a runnable proof-of-concept (often in a single evening, powered by AI autocompletion and copy-pastable cloud tooling).\xa0\\nIt might sound playful, but its implications are serious: if AI-assisted tools continue to lower the barrier to entry, we could see programming literacy expand dramatically. We\u2019ll be watching this space for bigger signals in the months and years to come.\\nWhere the world codes\u202fin\u202f2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last five years have redrawn not just GitHub\u2019s developer map, but also the distribution of global activity, faster than any period on record.\\nA new global top\u202f10\\nIndia added more than 5.2 million developers in 2025, which accounts for a little over 14% of GitHub\u2019s total +36 million new developers in 2025. That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\\n* Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) computed from raw counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed?\\nSignificant growth came from India, Brazil, and Indonesia. These regions combine large, young developer populations with expanding internet access and booming startup ecosystems. Many are also seeing some of the fastest growth in AI-related projects, as local companies adopt new tools to compete globally.\\nOver the past five years (from 2020 to 2025), India, Brazil, and Indonesia have more than quadrupled the number of developers on the platform; Japan and Germany have more than tripled their developer numbers; and the USA, UK, and Canada have more than doubled the number of developers on the platform.\\nBrazil, in particular, is benefiting from activity investment in fintech and open banking.\\nIndonesia continues to grow with its rise as Southeast Asia\u2019s digital powerhouse (it accounts for nearly half the region\u2019s online economy!).\\nRegional growth snapshots\\n\\nRegionStand\u2011out markets2024\u202fto \u202f2025 net new devsWhat\u2019s fueling the boom\\n\\nAPACIndia, Japan, Indonesia,\xa0+13MGovernment skilling, AI\u2011assisted local\u2011language tooling.

The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\\nNotably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\\nKey takeaways\\nOne in every three new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn\u2019t in the global top 10 in 2020.\\nIndia alone added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth.\\nThe AI boom is global:\u202fThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\xa0\xa0\\nOpen source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source development reached record levels this year with 1.12 billion contributions across public repositories (+13% YoY). March 2025 marked the largest single month of new open source contributors in GitHub history: 255,000 first-timers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 395 million public repositories hosted 1.12 billion contributions and 518.7 million merged pull requests\u2014each a record.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s fastest\u2011growing projects by contributors\\nSix of the 10 fastest-growing repositories were AI infrastructure projects, underscoring demand for runtimes, orchestration, and efficiency tools.\\nStandards also saw big growth: Model Context Protocol (MCP) hit 37k stars in just eight months, though it\u2019s not on our lists below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top open source projects by contributors\\n2025\u2019s top projects split between AI infrastructure (vllm, ollama, huggingface/transformers) and enduring ecosystems (vscode, godot, home-assistant).\\nOn one side, projects like vllm, ollama, ragflow, llama.cpp, and huggingface/transformers dominate, confirming that contributors are investing in the foundation layers of AI\u2014model runtimes, inference engines, and orchestration frameworks.\\nOn the other side, mainstay ecosystems such as vscode, godot, expo, and home-assistant continue to attract steady contributor bases, showing that open source momentum extends well beyond AI.\\nThe takeaway?

AI infrastructure projects are prominent among top-growth repositories. When we zoom out to the top 20 projects (not all of these are captured in our above graphic), we see a few things at play:\xa0\\nReproducibility and dependency hygiene are hot. The rise of astral-sh/uv and NixOS/nixpkgs points to a hunger for deterministic builds, faster installs, and less \u201cworks on my machine.\u201d\\nPerformance-centric developer tools win attention. Ghostty, Tailwind CSS, and uv are all about speed, tight feedback loops, and minimal friction.\\nDevelopers are contributing to projects that emphasize privacy and control. Zen Browser and Clash-Verge reflect interest in privacy, content control, and routing around networks.\\nOpen source social media continues to grow. As one of the biggest social projects, Bluesky\u2019s momentum suggests developers are still investing in open protocols and portable identity.\\nAI, tinkering, and frontend projects attract first-time contributors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 20% of the most popular open source projects among first-time contributors in 2025 were AI-focused. But we\u2019re also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\xa0\\nMost of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure. Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\\nMajor platforms bring visibility. microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\\nfirstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\\nSmart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers. Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d\\nFrontend and dev tool projects also light up. shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\\nAI\u2011native vs. evergreen ecosystems\\nAI podium. Six of the overall top 10 projects by total contributors are AI\u2011centric (vllm, huggingface/transformers, modelcontextprotocol/servers, llama.cpp, etc.). They averaged +150\u202f% contributor growth YoY\u2014triple the OSS median.\\nEvergreen pull. Internet of things (home\u2011assistant), game development (godotengine/godot), and the Python language itself (cpython) still add thousands of contributors per quarter.\\nThe global landscape in open source activity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia now has the largest public and open source contributor base in the world. This reflects both the country\u2019s booming developer population and its increasing role in OSS adoption.\\nThe U.S. continues to lead in contributions. Despite having fewer contributors, U.S.-based developers contributed more to public and open source projects on GitHub. This suggests higher per-developer activity.\\nBrazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier. Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\\nCommunity health: Governance isn\u2019t keeping pace with developer activity\\n\u200b\u200bGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\xa0\\nREADME reach: ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\xa0\\nContributor guides: At 5.5%, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\\nCodes of Conduct: 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They\u2019re foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration. This guide to getting your repository collaboration-ready shares what documentation is most important for fostering a sense of shared ownership.\\nKey takeaways for 2025\\n395M public and open source repositories (+19% YoY)\\n1.12B public and open source contributions (+13% YoY)\\n518.7M pull requests merged (+29% YoY)\\n60% of top 10 open source projects by contributors are AI\u2011focused\\nOnly 1\u202fin\u202f50 repositories ships with a Code of Conduct\\nSecurity: from \u201cshift left\u201d to secure\u202fby\u202fdefault\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\xa0\\nAutomation is driving this acceleration. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving common OWASP Top 10 issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\xa0\\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories (+172% YoY). Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub\u2019s engineers published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow, which offers some valuable lessons).\xa0\\nAutomation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\\nDevelopers are automating more build, test, and security activity. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That\u2019s up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year\u2019s report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\\nAutomation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy. Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\\nMonthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. Only ~1\u202fin\u202f3 fixes ships within the same month it\u2019s proposed.\\nSecurity alerts follow the same pattern: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\\nFaster fix times\\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\xa0\xa0\\nConfiguring and codifying security\\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in dependabot.yml more than doubled this year (846k, +137% YoY), marking a shift from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cpatch me automatically, within guardrails.\u201d\\n\\nSignal2024 (cumulative)2025\u202f (cumulative)YoY\\n\\nRepositories with dependabot.yml356k846k+137%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken Access Control overcame Injection to become the top CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories. New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\\nThis points to a broader issue: authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs. Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same category became the fastest-growing target for Copilot Autofix. By mid-2025, developers were accepting AI-generated fixes for Broken Access Control in 6,000+ repositories per month. Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\\nOpenSSF Scorecard status: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the OpenSSF Scorecard via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\xa0\\nThe top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\\nMethodology note\\nUnless otherwise specified, year-over-year growth rates throughout this section reflect August 2025 vs. August 2024, a same-month year-over-year comparison used to control for seasonality in monthly contributor counts.\\nTypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\\nPython remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (\u2248403k repositories; +17.8% YoY inside AI-tagged projects).\\nJavaScript is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn\u2019t just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed in 2025\\n\\nRank 2025LanguageYoY contributor gainYoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)Big takeaway\\n\\n1TypeScript~1,054,01566.63%TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development.\\n2Python~850,57948.78%Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python\u2019s usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work.\xa0\\n3JavaScript~427,14824.79%Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript.\\n4Java~174,70520.73%Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth.\\n5C#~136,735\xa022.22%Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython still trails the combined JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, a continuation of last year\u2019s trend that highlights just how large the typed and untyped JavaScript community remains.\xa0\\nBut starting in 2025, Python\u2019s growth curve began to track almost identically in parallel with JavaScript and TypeScript, suggesting that AI adoption is influencing language choice across these ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat else we\u2019re seeing\\nPython dominates AI projects. It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\\nTyped > loosely typed. TypeScript\u2019s growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as \u201cJavaScript\u201d activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\\nEnterprise stacks endure. Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\\nLegacy experiments emerge.

Though not a language, Jupyter Notebooks grew 24.5% YoY, with exploratory LLM experiments and data analysis now generating new standalone repos rather than remaining siloed in monorepos.\\nPerformance and systems languages are rising with AI (but not evenly). C grew ~20.9% YoY and C++ grew ~11.8% YoY, reflecting demand for faster runtimes, inference engines, and hardware-optimized loops.\\n.NET stays strong. C# grew ~10.6% YoY, consistent with enterprise and game/tooling ecosystems. This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\\nThe languages powering AI development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython and Jupyter Notebook continue to anchor new AI projects, but the story this year is Python\u2019s growth. Python now powers nearly half of all new AI repositories (582,196; +50.7% YoY), underscoring its role as the backbone of applied AI work, from training and inference to orchestration and deployment. Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for experimentation (402,643; +17.8% YoY), but the shift toward Python codebases signals more projects moving out of prototypes and into production stacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end and app-layer languages grew sharply from smaller bases\u2014TypeScript +77.9% (85,746) and JavaScript +24.8% (88,023)\u2014mirroring the rise of demos, dashboards, and lightweight apps built around model endpoints. Shell scripts (+324%) emerged as the fastest riser, reflecting how teams codify eval harnesses, data prep, and deployment pipelines. And C++ crossed 7,800 repos (+11%), a steady reminder of its role in performance-critical inference engines, runtimes, and hardware-close systems.\\nWhy TypeScript won in 2025\\nBy the numbers. TypeScript finished #1 on GitHub in August 2025 with 2,636,006 monthly contributors (+1.05M YoY; +66.6%) and led new repositories.\xa0\\nTyped contracts scale AI-assisted teams. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch LLM errors before production.\\nFrameworks ship with TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate a TypeScript codebase by default (npm create, pnpm dlx, or bunx create).\xa0\\nTyped systems help identify LLM-generated compile errors earlier in the pipeline. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures.\xa0\\nLow barrier to entry. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and IDE autoconfig hide boilerplate, so junior devs can spin up typed stacks quickly.\\nGenerative\u202fAI and agentic workflows become ordinary engineering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year we saw AI move from experiment to mainstream. In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\xa0\\nAI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million, nearly doubling in less than two years.\\nRoughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week, showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly contributors to generative-AI projects climbed sharply across our measurement year. From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan\u2013Aug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan\u2013Aug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\\nKey takeaways:\xa0\\nGenerative AI is becoming infrastructure. More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August \u201825 vs. August \u201824), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\xa0\\nGrowth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping. Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\xa0\\nAI in open source. Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using GitHub Copilot.\\nEarly evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot.

More than 693k+ were created in the last 12 months, sharply outpacing 2024\u2019s total (~400,000). The compounding curve that began in early 2023 shows no sign of tapering; every week, on average, we are still seeing new all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho\u2019s shipping the code?\\nThe U.S. remains the largest source of contributions (~12.8M, 31.8%). India ranks second (~5M, 12.5%) and leads by distinct repositories (405k vs. 342k).\\nA second tier (Germany, Japan, U.K., Korea, Canada, Brazil, Spain, France) contributes another ~40%, globalizing the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgentic tools are now being adopted in day-to-day workflows\\nThis year, GitHub Copilot coding agent went from demo to GA and we\u2019re starting to see its impact.\\nA first glimpse of coding agent shows 1+ million pull requests that were created between May 2025 and September 2025.\\nWhere it\u2019s showing up:\\nA repository-level comparison of public repositories with \u22651 coding agent-authored pull request vs. a random sample without Copilot coding agent shows strong selection effects: coding agent activity is skewed toward repositories with more stars, larger size, and greater age. In other words, teams aren\u2019t only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they\u2019re trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\xa0\\nWe invite the community to run within-repository experiments (A/B or stepped-wedge) and matched analyses conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We\u2019ll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\xa0\\nAI is driving notable breakouts in open source\\nGenerative AI projects continue to be among GitHub\u2019s most popular. Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\xa0\\n\\nRepository (age \u22643 yrs unless noted)AI connection\\n\\nvllm-project/vllmOpen source vision-language model + training/inference stack\\nggml-org/llama.cppLocal Llama inference on CPU/GPU\\ninfiniflow/ragflowEnd-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template\\ncline/cline\u201cLLM-native\u201d command-line shell that reasons over local context\\nhuggingface/transformers (6.6 yrs)Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat this tells us\\nSoftware infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity. Brand-new generative AI repositories (\u2264 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\\nStandards are emerging in real time. The rapid rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\\nAI is reshaping classic tooling. Projects like ollama and ragflow show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\\nAI is helping developers fix code, too\\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\\nBroken access control surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in 6,000+ repositories per month by mid-2025.\\nSecurity logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\\nAutofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues\u2014not just exotic vulnerabilities\u2014bringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\\nHere\u2019s how to stay ahead\\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI\u2014systems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis\u2014is emerging.\\nExpect AI libraries to become \u201cplumbing.\u201d If your stack can\u2019t load a model or pipe context into one, you\u2019ll feel legacy-bound quickly.\xa0\\nGo beyond notebooks. Package your experiments early to share them with others.\\nWatch the toolchain, not just the models. The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today\u2019s fast-rising repositories.\\nBuild for interoperability. Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\\nTake this with you\\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn\u2019t replace developers\u2014it would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\\nThe past year marked historic milestones:\xa0\\nIndia overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub. It\u2019s also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\\nTypeScript became the most used language for the first time, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\\nOpen source remains the foundation. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\\nThe story of 2025 isn\u2019t AI versus developers. It\u2019s about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\\nGlossary\\n2025: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\xa0\\nYear-over-year language comparisons: Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\\nContributions: Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\xa0\\nContributors: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\xa0\\nDeveloper: Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries\u2014from software development to data analysis and design.\\nTotal repositories: The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\\nProgramming language usage: Unless otherwise noted, \u201cmost used\u201d languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for \u201cTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.\u201d\\nAI-related repository: Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d \u201cLLM\u201d) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\\nAgentic workflows: Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\\nCopilot coding agent: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment\u2014subject to developer review and approval.\\nCopilot code review: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\\nGitHub Actions minutes: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\\nCodeQL: GitHub\u2019s semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\\nMona rank: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final \u201cMona Rank\u201d based on the summed rank.\\nLLM SDK: A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\xa0\\nMethodology\\nScope & coverage\\nOctoverse year: Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025.\\nUnless noted, metrics reflect public activity only. Public indicators are also available on the GitHub Innovation Graph. For country-level reporting there, we publish metrics only when \u2265100 unique developers performed the activity in the period.\\nTime windows\\nMonthly snapshots: Calendar-month metrics to show peaks/turning points (e.g., Aug 2025 language rankings).\\nTrailing-12-month (T12): Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925 vs Sep \u201923\u2013Aug \u201924 for year-over-year trends/averages.\\nLonger lookbacks: Historical context from Jan 2022 \u2192 Aug 2025 where relevant.\\nUnits & entities\\nContributors/developers: Monthly unique users per metric (e.g., per language). One user can appear in multiple categories in the same month, so these do not sum across categories.\\nRepositories: Counted in a month if created or active, per metric definition.\\nActivities: \u201cpushes,\u201d \u201cpull requests created/merged,\u201d \u201ccomments,\u201d etc., follow standard GitHub event definitions.\\nGrowth baselines\\nSame-month YoY: Month vs. the same month prior year (e.g., Aug \u201925 vs Aug \u201924) are used for milestones/seasonality control as in language comparisons.\\nT12 YoY: Trailing-12-month total or average vs the prior trailing-12-month metric are used for sustained trends (e.g., average monthly contributors, pull requests per month).\\nStock vs. flow (cumulative metrics): Stock = level at a point in time (e.g., SDK repos as of Aug \u201925). Flow = adds over a window (e.g., Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925). Labeled distinctly.\\nGeography\\nDevelopers are mapped to countries via self-reported locations, standardized to ISO country codes; country aggregates observe the \u2265100 developers publication threshold.\\nRepository & language classification\\nPrimary language: GitHub language detection (e.g., Linguist); mixed-language repositories are attributed to one primary language.\\nNotebooks: \u201cJupyter Notebook\u201d is a development-environment classification and is labeled transparently.\\nAI projects: Identified via signals such as generative-AI SDK usage (imports/dependencies) and related metadata.\\nOpen source quality signals: Presence of files/policies (e.g., codes of conduct) from repository metadata.\\nStatistical techniques\\nMonthly time-series tracking; cumulative counts for stock growth; Top-N rankings (contributors, repo counts, growth rates, activity volumes).\\nMinimum thresholds to reduce noise (e.g., lists may require \u22651,000 contributors or \u2265X repos; metric-specific).\\nUser de-duplication\\nCount unique users per time period and per metric to avoid within-slice double counting; cross-category duplication is expected by design.\\nData quality controls\\nExclude incomplete months (e.g., the current month) from YoY/T12.\\nFilter bots/automation where identifiable (account flags + behavioral heuristics).\\nEnforce minimum activity for inclusion in growth and rankings.\\nCross-validate against multiple internal/public sources (e.g., Innovation Graph).\\nInterpretation & reproducibility\\nSeasonality: motivates same-month YoY for snapshots and T12 for structure.\\nAttribution: primary language is repository-level; TypeScript/JavaScript mixes may appear under one language.\\nScope: public-only views undercount private activity but preserve directionality.\\nPublic counterparts for several metrics can be verified via the Innovation Graph.\\nDeveloper growth projections\\nForecasting models: a collection of time-series and regression models that use historical data and statistics to predict future outcomes. Forecasting models relied on historical GitHub data, sign-up rates and product usage, as well as market-sizing information.\xa0\\nAccuracy of forecasts: No forecast is ever accurate. Backtesting shows models used for forecasting growth projections were within reasonable levels of accuracy (less than 30% Mean Absolute Percentage Error).\\nExternal factors: Forecasts do not take into account competitive landscape changes, geopolitical/economic conditions, or future covariates (product/feature releases that may shift responses differently from historical data).\\n\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"GitHub Staff","description":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91454","categories":["News & insights","Octoverse"],"isoDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1","publishedDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","author":"GitHub Staff","summary":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Jamie Cooper","title":"Announcing the 2025 GitHub Partner Award winners \ud83c\udf89","link":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-the-2025-github-partner-award-winners/","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\\">\\n<html><body><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-moving tech industry, partnerships are a powerful engine for scale.

By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and tem- poral dynamics through sequential analysis of network events.

It\u2019s your likes, reviews, comments, and all the little traces you didn\u2019t mean to share. Together, they paint a picture of you\u2014one that friends, employers, and yes, scammers can see.\\nStep 1: \xa0Your active footprint\\nYour active footprint is everything you choose to share online. Every photo, product review, or status update you post adds another brushstroke to your online portrait. Over time, those choices form a public story about who you are\u2014your interests, values, and connections. That story shapes how people, employers, and even algorithms see you.\\nStep 2: Your passive footprint\\nYour passive footprint is the quieter one\u2014the data you leave behind without meaning to. Every website you visit, every cookie that tracks your clicks, every photo that quietly tags its GPS location adds to it. These fragments often work in the background, invisible but persistent, quietly mapping your habits, preferences, and even your movements.\\nYou step in more stuff than you think\\nYour personal data is scattered in more places than you\u2019d expect. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok hold snapshots of your life and relationships. Government databases, company websites, and news mentions might hold your name or location. Forums, review sites, and shopping accounts keep their own records. And data brokers collect and sell huge bundles of personal details, sometimes packaging them into lists anyone can buy. Even if you\u2019ve never shared something directly, chances are it\u2019s already out there.\\nAlone, small details don\u2019t seem like much\u2014a nickname here, a photo there\u2014but stitched together they can reveal a lot.

Combine that with info leaked in data breaches, and attackers can build an eerily complete version of you\u2014ready-made for scams or identity theft.\\nHow scammers collect your data\\nTo stay safe, it helps to see the world the way a scammer does: your online details are puzzle pieces, and they\u2019re putting the picture together.\\nScraping\\nAttackers use automated tools to pull information from public pages across the internet. That can include your bio, job history, or photos from social media, or your name and email address from company websites and online forums. All technically \u201cpublic,\u201d but when combined, they create a full dossier of your online life.\\nBreaches\\nWhen companies get hacked or fail to secure their databases, your data can spill into the open.

Leaks like these often contain names, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords\u2014and once data hits the dark web, it can circulate for years.

For the potentially millions of people affected, stay alert to fraud and identity theft.\\nProtecting yourself after a data breach\\nIf you think you\u2019ve been the\xa0victim of this or any other data breach, here are steps you can take to protect yourself:\\nCheck the vendor\u2019s advice.\xa0Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what\u2019s happened and follow any specific advice it offers.\\nChange your password.\xa0You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a\xa0strong password\xa0that you don\u2019t use for anything else. Better yet, let a\xa0password manager\xa0choose one for you.\\nEnable\xa0two-factor authentication\xa0(2FA).\xa0If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop, or phone as your second factor. Some forms of 2FA\xa0can be phished just as easily as a password, but 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can\u2019t be phished.\\nWatch out for fake vendors.\xa0The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the company\u2019s website to see if it\u2019s contacting victims and verify the\xa0identity of anyone who contacts you\xa0using a different communication channel.\\nTake your time.\xa0Phishing attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions, and security alerts.\\nConsider not storing your card details. It\u2019s definitely more convenient to let sites remember your card details, but we highly recommend not storing that information on websites.\\nSet up\xa0identity monitoring, which alerts you if your\xa0personal information\xa0is found being traded illegally online and helps you recover after.\\nWe don\u2019t just report on threats \u2013 we help safeguard your entire digital identity\\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. Protect your\u2014and your family\u2019s\u2014personal information by using identity protection.","description":" A reminder that one supplier\u2019s breach can ripple far, fueling phishing and ID theft long after the news fades.

I think that the ability of AI systems to create something deadly will advance faster than the ability of AI systems to detect its components.","id":"https://www.schneier.com/?p=71059","isoDate":"2025-10-30T11:05:16.000Z","feedKey":"schneier-security","feedTitle":"Schneier on Security","category":"cyber","cleanTitle":"The AI-Designed Bioweapon Arms Race","publishedDate":"2025-10-30T11:05:16.000Z"},{"creator":"Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer","title":"Data Leak Outs Hacker Students of Iran\'s MOIS Training Academy","link":"https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/data-leak-students-iran-mois-training-academy","pubDate":"Thu, 30 Oct 2025 06:00:00 GMT","dc:creator":"Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer","description":"Ravin Academy, a school for the Iranian state hackers of tomorrow, has itself, ironically, been hacked.","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt6d90778a997de1cd/bltadf85273d19e0ede/68d1ab774c68b01d432a44fa/iran_karen_roach_shutterstock.jpg?width=1280&auto=webp&quality=80&disable=upscale","medium":"image"},"media:title":[{"_":"iran_karen_roach_shutterstock.jpg","$":{"type":"html"}}]},"content":"Ravin Academy, a school for the Iranian state hackers of tomorrow, has itself, ironically, been hacked.","contentSnippet":"Ravin Academy, a school for the Iranian state hackers of tomorrow, has itself, ironically, been hacked.","guid":"https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/data-leak-students-iran-mois-training-academy","isoDate":"2025-10-30T06:00:00.000Z","feedKey":"dark-reading","feedTitle":"Dark Reading","category":"cyber","cleanTitle":"Data Leak Outs Hacker Students of Iran\'s MOIS Training Academy","publishedDate":"2025-10-30T06:00:00.000Z","author":"Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer","summary":"Ravin Academy, a school for the Iranian state hackers of tomorrow, has itself, ironically, been hacked."},{"creator":"Rob Wright","title":"Malicious NPM Packages Disguised With \'Invisible\' Dependencies","link":"https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/malicious-npm-packages-invisible-dependencies","pubDate":"Wed, 29 Oct 2025 20:43:21 GMT","dc:creator":"Rob Wright","description":"In the &quot;PhantomRaven&quot; campaign, threat actors published 126 malicious npm packages that have flown under the radar, while collecting 86,000 downloads.","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt6d90778a997de1cd/blt6adcfd5dc4d12199/690271d8d2c668bbb99b1ecd/invisibleman_ScottMacmillan_Alamy.jpg?width=1280&auto=webp&quality=80&disable=upscale","medium":"image"},"media:title":[{"_":"invisibleman_ScottMacmillan_Alamy.jpg","$":{"type":"html"}}]},"content":"In the &quot;PhantomRaven&quot; campaign, threat actors published 126 malicious npm packages that have flown under the radar, while collecting 86,000 downloads.","contentSnippet":"In the \\"PhantomRaven\\" campaign, threat actors published 126 malicious npm packages that have flown under the radar, while collecting 86,000 downloads.","guid":"https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/malicious-npm-packages-invisible-dependencies","isoDate":"2025-10-29T20:43:21.000Z","feedKey":"dark-reading","feedTitle":"Dark Reading","category":"cyber","cleanTitle":"Malicious NPM Packages Disguised With \'Invisible\' Dependencies","publishedDate":"2025-10-29T20:43:21.000Z","author":"Rob Wright","summary":"In the \\"PhantomRaven\\" campaign, threat actors published 126 malicious npm packages that have flown under the radar, while collecting 86,000 downloads."},{"title":" Atlas browser\u2019s Omnibox opens up new privacy and security risks ","link":"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/10/openais-atlas-browser-leaves-the-door-wide-open-to-prompt-injection","pubDate":"Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:48:06 GMT","content:encoded":"\\n<p>It seems that with every new agentic browser we discover yet another way to abuse one.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI recently <a href=\\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\\">introduced</a> a ChatGPT based AI browser called Atlas.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-72438\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png\\" alt=\\"Image credit: vxdb\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"415\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png 1421w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-768x425.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-782x433.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /></p>\\n<p>First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> &#8212; the biggest attack that <strong>Google</strong> had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p>\\n<p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote <strong>Roland Dobbins</strong>, principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>, in a recent <a href=\\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p>\\n<p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;<strong>residential proxy</strong>&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-31323\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"631\\" height=\\"264\\" /></p>\\n<p>From a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>\\n<p>And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH</h2>\\n<p><strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> is co-founder of <a href=\\"https://spur.us\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:</p>\\n<p>AUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097<br />\\nRAYOBYTE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 43,894<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa043,008<br />\\nWEBSHARE_PROXY\xa0 \xa039,800<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 32,723<br />\\nPROXYCHEAP_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,368<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,202<br />\\nMYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY\xa0 25,287<br />\\nHYPE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 18,185<br />\\nMASSIVE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 17,152</p>\\n<p>Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;</p>\\n<p>LUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421<br />\\nNETNUT_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 10,982,458<br />\\nABCPROXY_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 9,294,419<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa06,754,790<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa03,209,313<br />\\nEARNFM_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,659,913<br />\\nNODEMAVEN_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,627,851<br />\\nINFATICA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,335,194<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,032,027<br />\\nYILU_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 1,549,155<span id=\\"more-72424\\"></span></p>\\n<p>Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bright Data</strong> was formerly known as <strong>Luminati Networks</strong>, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said <strong>Rony Shalit</strong>, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and <a href=\\"https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a robust opt-in only residential peers</a>, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>HK NETWORK</h2>\\n<p>Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.</p>\\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\\"https://synthient.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Synthient</a>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own <strong>software development kit</strong> or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is <em>forced to install</em> some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p>\\n<p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.</p>\\n<p>Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy service is <strong>IPidea</strong>, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include <strong>ABCProxy </strong>(#3), <strong>Roxlabs</strong>, <strong>LunaProxy</strong>, <strong>PIA S5 Proxy</strong>, <strong>PyProxy</strong>, <strong>922Proxy</strong>, <strong>360Proxy</strong>, <strong>IP2World</strong>, and <strong>Cherry Proxy.\xa0</strong>Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said they also track <strong>Yilu Proxy\xa0</strong>(#10) as IPidea.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &#8220;<strong>HK Network</strong>.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The way it works is there&#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'&#8221; Brundage explained. &#8220;But they&#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72441\\" style=\\"width: 760px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72441\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"517\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png 1126w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-768x529.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-782x539.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-100x70.png 100w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\" /></a><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies.

In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-deep-dive-into-the-residential-proxy-service-911/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China</a>.

In May 2024, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">arrested Mr Wang</a>, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72454\\" style=\\"width: 759px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72454\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72454\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"494\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png 1182w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy-768x507.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy-782x516.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72454\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">The website for 922Proxy.</p></div>\\n<h2>DATA SCRAPING FOR AI</h2>\\n<p>In recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p>\\n<p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqleft\\">&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said.</span> &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p>\\n<p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">report</a> earlier this year from <strong>LibreNews</strong> found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">pay-per-crawl</a>&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p>\\n<p>On October 22, the social media and news network <strong>Reddit</strong> <a href=\\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Denas Grybauskas</strong>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p>\\n<p>In July, Google filed <a href=\\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME</h2>\\n<p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name <strong>fuckbriankrebs[.]com</strong>. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; and was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>\\n<p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72457\\" style=\\"width: 745px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72457 \\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"735\\" height=\\"707\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.\\n\\nFirst identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru\u2019s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.\\nIn June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second \u2014 the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru\u2019s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second \u2014 well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.\\nThese digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.\\n\u201cMultiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. \u201cOutbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.\u201d\\nThe incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru\u2019s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world\u2019s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.\\nExperts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else\u2019s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.\\n\\nFrom a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.\\nAnd as we\u2019ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.\\n\u2018INSANE\u2019 GROWTH\\nRiley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months \u2014 with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.\\n\u201cI just checked, and in the last 90 days we\u2019ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cThat is insane. That is so high of a number, it\u2019s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.\u201d\\nTo put Kilmer\u2019s comments in perspective, here was Spur\u2019s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:\\nAUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097\\nToday, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;\\nLUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421\\n\\nReached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur\u2019s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\\nBright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur\u2019s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur\u2019s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.\\n\u201cWe did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data\u2019s in some way,\u201d said Rony Shalit, Bright Data\u2019s chief compliance and ethics officer. \u201cIn many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.\u201d\\n\u201cOur network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,\u201d Shalit continued. \u201cEvery DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.\u201d\\nHK NETWORK\\nEven Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.\\nBenjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it\u2019s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What\u2019s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.\\nBrundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user\u2019s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.\\n\u201cProxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.\u201d\\nMany SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.\\nDepending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time \u2014 all maintained through other means, Brundage said.\\n\u201cOften, you\u2019ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.\u201d\\nSome proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider\u2019s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he\u2019d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.\\nBrundage says that by almost any measurement, the world\u2019s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur\u2019s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.\xa0Spur\u2019s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy\xa0(#10) as IPidea.\\nBrundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as \u201cHK Network.\u201d\\n\u201cThe way it works is there\u2019s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, \u2018Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we\u2019ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'\u201d Brundage explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.\u201d\\n\\nA graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.\\n\\nThose apps include a range of low-cost and \u201cfree\u201d virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user\u2019s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.\\n\u201cThey have all this bandwidth to offload,\u201d Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. \u201cAnd they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.\u201d\\nOne of IPidea\u2019s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy\u2019s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company\u2019s servers were massively hacked.\\nThat 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.\\n\\nThe website for 922Proxy.\\n\\nDATA SCRAPING FOR AI\\nIn recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That\u2019s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to block, because there\u2019s a risk of blocking real people,\u201d Spur\u2019s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.\\nKilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.\\n\u201cWeb crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cEverybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.\u201d\\nKilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.\\n\u201cWhere the cost of data is out of reach \u2014 there is some exclusivity or reason they can\u2019t access the data \u2014 they\u2019ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,\u201d Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.\\nAggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.\\nCloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company\u2019s \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.\\nOn October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.\\n\u201cRecognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThey do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.\u201d\\nDenas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.\\n\u201cReddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,\u201d Grybauskas said in a written statement. \u201cOxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.\u201d\\nAs big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.\\nIn July, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet\u2019s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet \u201ccompromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android\u2019s open-source software, which lacks Google\u2019s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.\u201d\\nA FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME\\nBrundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate \u201cscrew you\u201d to this site\u2019s author: One of the botnet\u2019s alleged partners goes by the handle \u201cForky,\u201d and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nBrundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru\u2019s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a \u201ckill switch\u201d capable of disrupting the botnet\u2019s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.\\n\\nA tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.\\n\\nFor one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d for the security intelligence company Seralys.\\nCaturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.\\nBut even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.\\n\u201cThe bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,\u201d he said. \u201cSo anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.\u201d\\n\\nCaturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.\\n\\nThe domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was used to spread malicious software by the Cutwail spam botnet. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by Russkill (a.k.a. \u201cDirt Jumper\u201d).\\nDomaintools.com finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to David \u201cAbdilo\u201d Crees, a 27-year-old Australian man sentenced in May 2025 to time served for cybercrime convictions related to the Lizard Squad hacking group.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/#comments","description":"Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic.

To execute these flaws, an attacker would social engineer a target into previewing an email with a malicious Microsoft Office document.\\nSpeaking of Office, Microsoft quietly announced this week that Microsoft Word will now automatically save documents to OneDrive, Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-bellingcat-donate-block\\"><div><div class=\\"wp-block-image alignleft\\">\\n<figure class=\\"is-resized\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/05/question-mark.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"27\\" height=\\"27\\"/></div></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Support Bellingcat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\\">\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-button\\"><a class=\\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\\" href=\\"https://bellingcat.com/donate?utm_campaign=article_cta\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Donate</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Denis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">poisoned</a> by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"600\\" height=\\"978\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49959\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg 600w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi-184x300.jpg 184w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Vladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by <em>Monika Pakhomi (left) </em>on Nov. 8, 2019.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

AOL\u2019s 30 million monthly active users represent an enduring brand and a data-rich resource that can be used in AI-driven services. That statement is true only if the data is properly governed and integrated. Such deals may blend nostalgia with business advantage, but present new compliance and cybersecurity risks that enterprises need to address.</p>\\n<p>By acquiring AOL from Yahoo, Bending Spoons moves to consolidate high-retention consumer technologies in its expanding digital portfolio. As companies turn increasingly to synthetic data to feed their AI&#8217;s learning corpus, the deal shows a different tactic, one of using established data assets and user bases to accelerate AI personalisation, advertising efficiency, and digital identity information gathering. It illustrates how older platforms \u2013 perhaps written off as legacy \u2013 can become profitable fuel for innovation when combined with cloud-native architectures and machine learning models.</p>\\n<p>Bending Spoons has financed its expansion strategy with a $2.8 billion debt package from major global banks that include J.P. Morgan, BNP Paribas, and HSBC. There&#8217;s clearly growing lender confidence in the long-term monetisation of data, unlike during the &#8216;dot.com&#8217; boom and bust, where the emphasis and interest was in purely software products. The acquisition, expected to close by year-end, follows Bending Spoons&#8217; planned purchase of Vimeo. The two deals, if they go through, position the company as a major consolidator of internet assets.</p>\\n<h3>Implementation and operational challenges</h3>\\n<p>Integrating decades-old infrastructure like AOL\u2019s presents technical challenges. Data migration from legacy email systems in line with current-day security protocols and compliance requirements needs careful stewardship. There&#8217;s also the not-insignificant issue of retraining staff for AI data stewardship on data that comes with significant buy-in from trusting service users. As with any digital acquisition, therefore, Bending Spoons&#8217; success will depend on managing the technical and cultural dimensions of integration. Without strong governance, promising legacy platforms risk becoming compliance liabilities.</p>\\n<p>Early in any acquisition cycle, there will have been preparatory work in mapping data lineage, running integration and interoperability audits, and significant governance discussions. It&#8217;s worth noting that many integration pilots stall without shared accountability between technology and business functions: It&#8217;s easier to covet data than to work out how it can be put to business use, especially when the best an acquirer can hope for are limited examples of what they might get, once the ink has dried on the cheque.</p>\\n<h3>Vendor and ecosystem context</h3>\\n<p>Although Bending Spoons operates independently of major enterprise AI ecosystems, the logic of its acquisition aligns with Microsoft\u2019s integration of LinkedIn data into Azure AI Foundry, and IBM\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate legacy data with watsonx. AOL\u2019s customer base and behavioural data could feasibly hold value with cloud analytics, customer profiling, and identity management frameworks, on even off-the-shelf platforms like AWS Bedrock, Azure, or Google Vertex AI.</p>\\n<h3>Executive takeaway</h3>\\n<p>Legacy platforms are not obsolete but they are often underused and undervalued. The differentiator lies in how organisations integrate historical data into modern AI governance and value delivery. Executives may see the AOL acquisition as a nostalgia play, but it&#8217;s a more hard-nosed imagining of a pure data asset. Perhaps the next wave of competitive advantage may come not from building new systems, but from reinterpreting older software and information that&#8217;s sometimes disregarded, simply because it&#8217;s not the latest-and-greatest &#8216;thing.&#8217;</p>\\n<p><em>(Image source: &#8220;<a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/43163345@N06/6758894579\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Spoon</a>&#8221; by <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/43163345@N06\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">felixtsao</a> is licensed under <a href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=openverse\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">CC BY 2.0</a>.)</em></p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\\" /></a></p>\\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

AOL\u2019s 30 million monthly active users represent an enduring brand and a data-rich resource that can be used in AI-driven services. That statement is true only if the data is properly governed and integrated. Such deals may blend nostalgia with business advantage, but present new compliance and cybersecurity risks that enterprises need to address.\\nBy acquiring AOL from Yahoo, Bending Spoons moves to consolidate high-retention consumer technologies in its expanding digital portfolio. As companies turn increasingly to synthetic data to feed their AI\u2019s learning corpus, the deal shows a different tactic, one of using established data assets and user bases to accelerate AI personalisation, advertising efficiency, and digital identity information gathering. It illustrates how older platforms \u2013 perhaps written off as legacy \u2013 can become profitable fuel for innovation when combined with cloud-native architectures and machine learning models.\\nBending Spoons has financed its expansion strategy with a $2.8 billion debt package from major global banks that include J.P. Morgan, BNP Paribas, and HSBC. There\u2019s clearly growing lender confidence in the long-term monetisation of data, unlike during the \u2018dot.com\u2019 boom and bust, where the emphasis and interest was in purely software products. The acquisition, expected to close by year-end, follows Bending Spoons\u2019 planned purchase of Vimeo. The two deals, if they go through, position the company as a major consolidator of internet assets.\\nImplementation and operational challenges\\nIntegrating decades-old infrastructure like AOL\u2019s presents technical challenges. Data migration from legacy email systems in line with current-day security protocols and compliance requirements needs careful stewardship. There\u2019s also the not-insignificant issue of retraining staff for AI data stewardship on data that comes with significant buy-in from trusting service users. As with any digital acquisition, therefore, Bending Spoons\u2019 success will depend on managing the technical and cultural dimensions of integration. Without strong governance, promising legacy platforms risk becoming compliance liabilities.\\nEarly in any acquisition cycle, there will have been preparatory work in mapping data lineage, running integration and interoperability audits, and significant governance discussions. It\u2019s worth noting that many integration pilots stall without shared accountability between technology and business functions: It\u2019s easier to covet data than to work out how it can be put to business use, especially when the best an acquirer can hope for are limited examples of what they might get, once the ink has dried on the cheque.\\nVendor and ecosystem context\\nAlthough Bending Spoons operates independently of major enterprise AI ecosystems, the logic of its acquisition aligns with Microsoft\u2019s integration of LinkedIn data into Azure AI Foundry, and IBM\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate legacy data with watsonx. AOL\u2019s customer base and behavioural data could feasibly hold value with cloud analytics, customer profiling, and identity management frameworks, on even off-the-shelf platforms like AWS Bedrock, Azure, or Google Vertex AI.\\nExecutive takeaway\\nLegacy platforms are not obsolete but they are often underused and undervalued. The differentiator lies in how organisations integrate historical data into modern AI governance and value delivery. Executives may see the AOL acquisition as a nostalgia play, but it\u2019s a more hard-nosed imagining of a pure data asset. Perhaps the next wave of competitive advantage may come not from building new systems, but from reinterpreting older software and information that\u2019s sometimes disregarded, simply because it\u2019s not the latest-and-greatest \u2018thing.\u2019\\n(Image source: \u201cSpoon\u201d by felixtsao is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor recovery reflects calculated strategic pivots made during its downturn, market dynamics that finally shifted in its favour, and intense competitive pressures that forced the company to accelerate its AI chip roadmap.</p>\\n<h3>The road back from the slump</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s journey to this quarter&#8217;s performance began in a different place. Throughout 2024 and into early 2025, the company faced multiple headwinds: a brutal memory chip glut that collapsed prices, delayed qualification of its HBM products with key customers, and the company seeing rival SK Hynix capture early leadership in AI memory chips.</p>\\n<p>The low point came in the second quarter of 2025, when Samsung&#8217;s chip division reported operating profit that had analysts questioning whether the company had lost its technological edge. SK Hynix had seized the top spot in the memory market for the first time, fueled by its early success supplying HBM chips to Nvidia&#8217;s AI accelerators.</p>\\n<p>MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, <a href=\\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/samsumg-reclaims-global-memory-market-top-spot-in-Q3-2025-driven-by-robust-dram-nand-demand\\">contextualised</a> Samsung&#8217;s third-quarter performance as &#8220;a clear result of a broader memory market boom and rising prices for general-purpose memory.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>But Hwang&#8217;s firm also noted that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market from SK Hynix during Q3, suggesting the semiconductor recovery involved more than just favourable market conditions.</p>\\n<h3>HBM: From laggard to mass production</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s ability to reverse its HBM fortunes proved central to the turnaround. The company confirmed that HBM3E is now &#8220;in mass production and being sold to all related customers,&#8221; while HBM4 samples are &#8220;simultaneously being shipped to key clients.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Reports emerged in late September that Samsung had passed Nvidia&#8217;s qualification tests for advanced high-bandwidth memory chips \u2013 a important milestone that had eluded the company for months. While Samsung hasn&#8217;t confirmed the Nvidia qualification publicly, the timing aligns with the acceleration in HBM sales reflected in Q3 results.</p>\\n<p>During the company&#8217;s earnings call, a Samsung executive outlined the demand environment: &#8220;We expect data centre companies to continuously expand their hardware investment because of the ongoing competition to secure AI infrastructure. Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>That supply-demand imbalance has created pricing power that Samsung lacked during its declining quarters. The company specifically cited &#8220;a favourable price environment&#8221; and &#8220;notably reduced one-off costs like inventory value adjustments&#8221; as contributors to higher profits.</p>\\n<h3>Beyond memory: Foundry progress and challenges</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor recovery extended beyond memory chips.

Samsung\u2019s semiconductor recovery reflects calculated strategic pivots made during its downturn, market dynamics that finally shifted in its favour, and intense competitive pressures that forced the company to accelerate its AI chip roadmap.\\nThe road back from the slump\\nSamsung\u2019s journey to this quarter\u2019s performance began in a different place. Throughout 2024 and into early 2025, the company faced multiple headwinds: a brutal memory chip glut that collapsed prices, delayed qualification of its HBM products with key customers, and the company seeing rival SK Hynix capture early leadership in AI memory chips.\\nThe low point came in the second quarter of 2025, when Samsung\u2019s chip division reported operating profit that had analysts questioning whether the company had lost its technological edge. SK Hynix had seized the top spot in the memory market for the first time, fueled by its early success supplying HBM chips to Nvidia\u2019s AI accelerators.\\nMS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, contextualised Samsung\u2019s third-quarter performance as \u201ca clear result of a broader memory market boom and rising prices for general-purpose memory.\u201d\\nBut Hwang\u2019s firm also noted that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market from SK Hynix during Q3, suggesting the semiconductor recovery involved more than just favourable market conditions.\\nHBM: From laggard to mass production\\nSamsung\u2019s ability to reverse its HBM fortunes proved central to the turnaround. The company confirmed that HBM3E is now \u201cin mass production and being sold to all related customers,\u201d while HBM4 samples are \u201csimultaneously being shipped to key clients.\u201d\\nReports emerged in late September that Samsung had passed Nvidia\u2019s qualification tests for advanced high-bandwidth memory chips \u2013 a important milestone that had eluded the company for months. While Samsung hasn\u2019t confirmed the Nvidia qualification publicly, the timing aligns with the acceleration in HBM sales reflected in Q3 results.\\nDuring the company\u2019s earnings call, a Samsung executive outlined the demand environment: \u201cWe expect data centre companies to continuously expand their hardware investment because of the ongoing competition to secure AI infrastructure. Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply.\u201d\\nThat supply-demand imbalance has created pricing power that Samsung lacked during its declining quarters. The company specifically cited \u201ca favourable price environment\u201d and \u201cnotably reduced one-off costs like inventory value adjustments\u201d as contributors to higher profits.\\nBeyond memory: Foundry progress and challenges\\nSamsung\u2019s semiconductor recovery extended beyond memory chips. The Foundry Business, which manufactures chips designed by other companies, \u201cposted a significant improvement in earnings in Q3 2025, stemming from a reduction in one-off costs and better fab use.\u201d The division also achieved \u201crecord-high customer orders, mainly on advanced nodes.\u201d\\nThe foundry business is ramping up mass production of 2-nanometer Gate-All-Around (GAA) products, an important technology that helps maintain competitiveness against TSMC, the company that dominates the foundry market. Samsung indicated it would begin operations at its fab in Taylor, Texas, \u201cin a timely manner\u201d in 2026.\\nHowever, the System LSI Business, which designs Samsung\u2019s Exynos processors and image sensors, saw earnings stall \u201cdue to seasonality and customer inventory adjustments.\u201d\\nWhat this means for 2026\\nSamsung\u2019s guidance for the coming year reflects confidence that the semiconductor recovery has staying power. The Memory Business will \u201cfocus on the mass production of HBM4 products with differentiated performance\u201d while aiming to \u201cscale out the HBM sales base.\u201d\\nThe company plans capacity expansion in its 1c manufacturing process to meet projected HBM4 demand increases. Consolidated revenue for the quarter reached KRW 86.1 trillion, a 15.4% increase from the previous quarter and 8.85% higher year-over-year.

The interface has been simplified to make it \u201cmuch easier to quickly review the changes an agent has made\u201d. This allows developers to dive deeper into the code only when necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCursor 2.0 also introduces a \u201cnative browser tool\u201d that enables the AI agent to test its own work automatically. The agent can then iterate on its solution, running tests and making adjustments until it produces the \u201ccorrect final result\u201d. This marks a step towards a more autonomous development process, where agents can not only write code but also validate it.\\nSee also: OpenAI unveils open-weight AI safety models for developers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

href=\\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro\\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)</a> is a simple, common way for AI models (LLMs) to talk to APIs and data. Think of it like a universal plug: if both sides support MCP, they can connect and work together. An MCP server is any service or app that &ldquo;speaks MCP&rdquo; and offers tools the model can use, publishing a list of tools, what each tool does, and what inputs (parameters) each tool needs.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?utm_source=blog-github-mcp-server&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25post\\">The GitHub MCP Server</a> is the foundation for many <a href=\\"https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=blog-copilot-feature&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25post\\">GitHub Copilot</a> workflows, both inside and outside of GitHub. As an engineering team working on GitHub MCP, we&rsquo;re always looking to deliver new features and functionality, while avoiding regressions and improving quality with every iteration. And how we name a tool, explain what it does, and spell out its parameters directly affects whether the model picks the right tool, in the right order, with the right arguments.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to our work, small edits matter: tightening a description, adding or removing a tool, or combining a few similar tools can shift results a lot. When descriptions are off, agents choose the wrong tool, skip a step, send arguments in the wrong format, or drop them entirely. The outcome is weak. We need a safe way to change MCP and know if things actually got better, not worse. That&rsquo;s where offline evaluation comes in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Offline evaluation catches regressions before users see them and keeps the feedback loop short, so we can ship changes that genuinely improve performance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article walks through our evaluation pipeline and explains the metrics and algorithms that help us achieve these goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-automated-offline-evaluation-works\\">How automated offline evaluation works</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our offline evaluation pipeline checks how well our tool prompts work across different models. The tool instructions are kept simple and precise so the model can choose the right tool and fill in the correct parameters. Because LLMs vary in how they use tools, we systematically test each model&ndash;MCP pairing to measure compatibility, quality, and gaps.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-quick-intro-to-mcp-hosting\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Quick intro to MCP hosting</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MCP host or agent connects to one or more MCP servers, fetches their tool lists, and passes that info&mdash;along with the user&rsquo;s request&mdash;to the LLM.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How it works (step by step):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>The MCP server exposes tools (with names, descriptions, and required inputs).</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>The agent pulls that tool list and gives it to the model.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>When the user asks something, the LLM decides if it needs a tool.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>If yes, it picks a tool and fills in the inputs.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>The agent calls the tool on the MCP server and returns the result to the LLM, which then forms the final answer.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have curated datasets that we use as benchmarks.

Think of it like a universal plug: if both sides support MCP, they can connect and work together. An MCP server is any service or app that \u201cspeaks MCP\u201d and offers tools the model can use, publishing a list of tools, what each tool does, and what inputs (parameters) each tool needs.\xa0\\nThe GitHub MCP Server is the foundation for many GitHub Copilot workflows, both inside and outside of GitHub. As an engineering team working on GitHub MCP, we\u2019re always looking to deliver new features and functionality, while avoiding regressions and improving quality with every iteration. And how we name a tool, explain what it does, and spell out its parameters directly affects whether the model picks the right tool, in the right order, with the right arguments.\xa0\\nWhen it comes to our work, small edits matter: tightening a description, adding or removing a tool, or combining a few similar tools can shift results a lot. When descriptions are off, agents choose the wrong tool, skip a step, send arguments in the wrong format, or drop them entirely. The outcome is weak. We need a safe way to change MCP and know if things actually got better, not worse. That\u2019s where offline evaluation comes in.\\nOffline evaluation catches regressions before users see them and keeps the feedback loop short, so we can ship changes that genuinely improve performance.\\nThis article walks through our evaluation pipeline and explains the metrics and algorithms that help us achieve these goals.\\nHow automated offline evaluation works\\nOur offline evaluation pipeline checks how well our tool prompts work across different models. The tool instructions are kept simple and precise so the model can choose the right tool and fill in the correct parameters. Because LLMs vary in how they use tools, we systematically test each model\u2013MCP pairing to measure compatibility, quality, and gaps.\\nQuick intro to MCP hosting\\nMCP host or agent connects to one or more MCP servers, fetches their tool lists, and passes that info\u2014along with the user\u2019s request\u2014to the LLM.\\nHow it works (step by step):\\nThe MCP server exposes tools (with names, descriptions, and required inputs).\\nThe agent pulls that tool list and gives it to the model.\\nWhen the user asks something, the LLM decides if it needs a tool.\\nIf yes, it picks a tool and fills in the inputs.\\nThe agent calls the tool on the MCP server and returns the result to the LLM, which then forms the final answer.\\nWe have curated datasets that we use as benchmarks. Every benchmark contains the following parameters:\xa0\\nInput: This is a user request formulated in natural language.\xa0\\nExpected tools: Tools we expect to be called.\\nExpected arguments: Arguments we expect to be passed to each tool.\\nHere are a few examples:\\nAsking how many issues were created in a given time period\\nInput:\xa0 How many issues were created in the github/github-mcp-server repository during April 2025?\xa0\\nExpected tools: list_issues with arguments:\\nowner: github \\nrepo: github-mcp-server \\nsince: 2025-04-01T00:00:00Z\\nMerging pull requests\\nInput: Merge PR 123 in github/docs using squash merge with title \u201cUpdate installation guide\u201d\\nExpected tools: merge_pull_request with arguments:\\nowner: github\\nrepo: docs \\npullNumber: 123 \\nmerge_method: squash \\ncommit_title: Update installation guide\\nRequesting code reviews\\nInput: Request reviews from alice456 and bob123 for PR 67 in team/project-alpha\\nExpected tools: update_pull_request with arguments:\xa0\\nowner: team \\nrepo: project-alpha \\npullNumber: 67\\nreviewers: [\\"alice456\\", \\"bob123\\"]\\nSummarizing discussion comments\\nInput: Summarize the comments in discussion 33801, in the facebook/react repository\xa0\\nExpected tools: get_discussion_comments with arguments:\\nowner: facebook\\nrepo: react\\ndiscussionNumber: 33801\\nThe evaluation pipeline has three stages: fulfillment, evaluation, and summarization.\\nFulfillment: We run each benchmark across multiple models, providing the list of available MCP tools with every request. For each run, we record which tools the model invoked and the arguments it supplied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation: We process the raw outputs and compute metrics and scores.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummarization: We aggregate dataset-level statistics and produce the final evaluation report.\\nEvaluation metrics and algorithms\\nOur evaluation targets two aspects: whether the model selects the correct tools and whether it supplies correct arguments.\\nTool selection\\nWhen benchmarks involve a single tool call, tool selection reduces to a multi-class classification problem. Each benchmark is labeled with the tool it expects, and each tool is a \u201cclass.\u201d\\nModels tasked with this classification are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\\nAccuracy is the simplest measure that shows the percentage of correct classifications. In our case it means the percentage of inputs that resulted in an expected tool call. This is calculated on the whole dataset.\\nPrecision shows the proportion of the cases for which the tool was called correctly out of all cases where the tool was called. Low precision means the model picks the tool even for the cases where the tool is not expected to be called.\\nRecall shows the proportion of correctly called tools out of all cases where the given tool call was expected. Low recall may indicate that the model doesn\u2019t understand that the tool needs to be called and fails to call the tool or calls another tool instead.\\nF1-score is a harmonic mean showing how well the model is doing in terms of both precision and recall.\xa0\\nIf the model confuses two tools, it can result in low precision or recall for these tools.\\nWe have two similar tools that used to be confused often, which are list_issues and search_issues. Let\u2019s say we have 10 benchmarks for list_issues\xa0 and 10 benchmarks for search_issues. Imagine list_issues is called correctly in all of 10 cases and on top in 30% of cases where search_issues should be called.\\nThis means we\u2019re going to have lower recall for search_issues and lower precision for list_issues:\\nPrecision (list_issues) = 10 (cases where tool is called correctly) / (10 + 3 (cases where tool is called instead of search_issues)) = 0.77\\nRecall (search_issues) =\xa0 7 (tool was called correctly) / 10 (cases where tool is expected to be called) = 0.7\\nIn order to have visibility into what tools are confused with each other, we build a confusion matrix. Confusion matrix for the search_issues and list_issues tools from the example above would look the following:\\n\\nExpected tool / Called toolsearch_issueslist_issues\\n\\nsearch_issues73\\nlist_issues010\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe confusion matrix allows us to see the reason behind low precision and recall for certain tools and tweak their descriptions to minimize confusion.\\nArgument correctness\\nSelecting the right tool isn\u2019t enough. The model must also supply correct arguments. We\u2019ve defined a set of argument-correctness metrics that pinpoint specific issues, making regressions easy to diagnose and fix.\\nWe track four argument-quality metrics:\\nArgument hallucination: How often the model supplies argument names that aren\u2019t defined for the tool.\\nAll expected arguments provided: Whether every expected argument is present.\\nAll required arguments provided: Whether all required arguments are included.\\nExact value match: Whether provided argument values match the expected values exactly.\\nThese metrics are computed for tools that were correctly selected. The final report summarizes each tool\u2019s performance across all four metrics.\\nLooking forward and filling the gaps\\nThe current evaluation framework gives us a solid read on tool performance against curated datasets, but there\u2019s still room to improve.\\nMore is better\\nBenchmark volume is the weak point of offline evaluation. With so many classes (tools), we need more robust per-tool coverage. Evaluations based on just a couple of examples aren\u2019t dependable alone. Adding more benchmarks is always useful to increase the reliability of classification evaluation and other metrics.\\nEvaluation of multi-tool flows\\nOur current pipeline handles only single tool calls. In practice, tools are often invoked sequentially, with later calls consuming the outputs of earlier ones. To evaluate these flows, we must go beyond fetching the MCP tool list and actually execute tool calls (or mock their responses) during evaluation.\\nWe\u2019ll also update summarization. Today we treat tool selection as multi-class classification, which assumes one tool per input. For flows where a single input can trigger multiple tools, multi-label classification is the better fit.\\nTake this with you\\nOffline evaluation gives us a fast, safe way to iterate on MCP, so models pick the right GitHub tools with the right arguments. By combining curated benchmarks with clear metrics\u2014classification scores for tool selection and targeted checks for argument quality\u2014we turn vague \u201cit seems better\u201d into measurable progress and actionable fixes.\\nWe\u2019re not stopping here. We\u2019re expanding benchmark coverage, refining tool descriptions to reduce confusion, and extending the pipeline to handle real multi-tool flows with execution or faithful mocks. These investments mean fewer regressions, clearer insights, and more reliable agents that help developers move faster.\\nMost importantly, this work raises the bar for product quality without slowing delivery.

At GitHub, we\u2019ve always worked to solve these kinds of systemic challenges\u2014by making Git accessible, code review systematic with pull requests, and automating deployment with Actions.\xa0\\nWith 180 million developers, GitHub is growing at its fastest rate ever\u2014a new developer joining every second. What\u2019s more, 80% of new developers are using Copilot in their first week. AI isn\u2019t just a tool anymore; it\u2019s an integral part of the development experience. Our responsibility is to ensure this new era of collaboration is powerful, secure, and seamlessly integrated into the workflow you already trust.\\nAt GitHub Universe, we\u2019re announcing Agent HQ, GitHub\u2019s vision for the next evolution of our platform. Agents shouldn\u2019t be bolted on. They should work the way you already work. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making agents native to the GitHub flow.\\nAgent HQ transforms GitHub into an open ecosystem that unites every agent on a single platform. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, xAI, and more will become available directly within GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo bring this vision to life, we\u2019re shipping a suite of new capabilities built on the primitives you trust. This starts with a mission control, a single command center to assign, steer, and track the work of multiple agents from anywhere. It extends to VS Code with new ways to plan and customize agent behavior. And it is backed by enterprise-grade functionality: a new generation of agentic code review, a dedicated control plane to govern AI access and agent behavior, and a metrics dashboard to understand the impact of AI on your work.\xa0\\nWe are also deeply committed to investing in our platform and strengthening the primitives you rely on every day. This new world of development is powered by that foundational work, and we look forward to sharing more updates.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s dive in.\\nIn this post\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nIncreased confidence and control for your team\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\xa0\xa0\\nThe future is about giving you the power to orchestrate a fleet of specialized agents to perform complex tasks in parallel, not juggling a patchwork of disconnected tools or relying on a single agent. As the pioneer of asynchronous collaboration, we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to make sure these next-generation async tools just work.\xa0\\nWith Agent HQ what\u2019s not changing is just as important as what is. You\u2019re still working with the primitives you know\u2014Git, pull requests, issues\u2014and using your preferred compute, whether that\u2019s GitHub Actions or self-hosted runners. You\u2019re accessing agents through your existing paid Copilot subscription.\xa0\\nOn top of that foundation, we\u2019re opening the doors to a new world of capability. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI will be available on GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\nDon\u2019t want to wait? Starting this week, Copilot Pro+ users can begin working with \xa0OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders, the first of our partner agents to extend beyond its native surfaces and directly into the editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nThe power of Agent HQ comes from mission control, a unified command center that follows you wherever you work.

Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub</strong>. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>AI is reshaping choices, not just code. </strong>In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that&rsquo;s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And one of the biggest things in 2025? <strong>Agents are here.</strong> Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we&rsquo;re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128161; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a visual learner, we have you covered.&#128071;</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\"><div class=\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\">\\n<iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" title=\\"Octoverse 2025: AI, India, and the new #1 programming language\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"281\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-u6dUg6IJk?feature=oembed\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\\">The state&#8239;of&#8239;GitHub in&#8239;2025: A year of record growth</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1152\\" height=\\"288\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288\\" alt=\\"Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91477\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1152 1152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1024 1024w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million.

Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub\u2014over 36 million in the past year. It\u2019s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.\xa0\\nThe release of GitHub Copilot Free in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged 43.2 million pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)\u2014including a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\xa0\\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s data highlights three key shifts:\xa0\\nGenerative\u202fAI is now standard in development. More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug \u201825 vs. Aug \u201824). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn\u2019t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is reshaping choices, not just code. In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that\u2019s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? Agents are here. Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we\u2019re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s jump in.\\n\ud83d\udca1 Oh, and if you\u2019re a visual learner, we have you covered.\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state\u202fof\u202fGitHub in\u202f2025: A year of record growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\\nSo, what does \u201cmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average\u201d actually mean?\xa0\\nDevelopers are converging on GitHub. More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\xa0\\nAI adoption starts immediately. We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use GitHub Copilot within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\xa0\\nThe talent boom is geographically diverse. Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\xa0\\nGitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of Copilot Free in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub\u2019s dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\\n\\n2025\u2011YTD lensContributionsShare of totalWhat it signals\\n\\nPrivate repositories4.97B\u2248\u202f81.5%Enterprise and team\u2011level collaboration is happening on GitHub.\xa0\\nPublic repositories1.12B\u2248\u202f18.5%The volume of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey numbers\\n180M+ developers are now on GitHub\\n630M total repositories with +121M new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\\n+58M private repositories (up \u202f33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\xa0\\nOpen source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub. 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\\nDeveloper productivity: shipping more, waiting less\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following the SPACE framework (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year\u2019s data.\\nDeveloper activity reached record levels in 2025\\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\\n\\nActivity2024 monthly average2025 monthly average\\n\\nIssues closed\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4M4.25M\\nPull requests merged\u202f35M43.2M\\nCode pushes65M82.19M\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the preview of Copilot coding agent in March and the introduction of Copilot code review in April. In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\xa0\\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\\nPull requests created: +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\\nIssues created: +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\\nComments on issues/PRs: essentially flat (+0.35%)\\nComments on commits: down -27% (sharp decline)\\nThese are observational signals rather than causal claims and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks and Dockerfiles highlight two stages of modern development\\nNotebooks are now a mature tool for experimentation, while Dockerfiles are considered the bridge to reproducibility and production. In 2025, 2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY) and 1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY). This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\\n\\nRepositories in\u202f2024Repositories in\u202f2025Delta\\n\\nJupyter Notebook present\u202f1.4M2.42M\xa0+75%\\nDockerfile present\u202f875k1.9M+120%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents enter the mainstream\\nAI code\u202freview helps developers. We conducted in-depth interviews with developers about their code review process and found that 72.6% of developers who use Copilot code review said it improved their effectiveness.\xa0\\nDevelopers are using AI and agentic tools to build and share their work faster. Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\xa0\\nWhat about vibe coding?\xa0\\nOne notable trend in 2025 was \u201cvibe coding.\u201d First coined by Andrej Karparthy, vibe coding emerged as shorthand for a developer workflow that starts with an idea and jumps straight to a runnable proof-of-concept (often in a single evening, powered by AI autocompletion and copy-pastable cloud tooling).\xa0\\nIt might sound playful, but its implications are serious: if AI-assisted tools continue to lower the barrier to entry, we could see programming literacy expand dramatically. We\u2019ll be watching this space for bigger signals in the months and years to come.\\nWhere the world codes\u202fin\u202f2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last five years have redrawn not just GitHub\u2019s developer map, but also the distribution of global activity, faster than any period on record.\\nA new global top\u202f10\\nIndia added more than 5.2 million developers in 2025, which accounts for a little over 14% of GitHub\u2019s total +36 million new developers in 2025. That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\\n* Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) computed from raw counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed?\\nSignificant growth came from India, Brazil, and Indonesia. These regions combine large, young developer populations with expanding internet access and booming startup ecosystems. Many are also seeing some of the fastest growth in AI-related projects, as local companies adopt new tools to compete globally.\\nOver the past five years (from 2020 to 2025), India, Brazil, and Indonesia have more than quadrupled the number of developers on the platform; Japan and Germany have more than tripled their developer numbers; and the USA, UK, and Canada have more than doubled the number of developers on the platform.\\nBrazil, in particular, is benefiting from activity investment in fintech and open banking.\\nIndonesia continues to grow with its rise as Southeast Asia\u2019s digital powerhouse (it accounts for nearly half the region\u2019s online economy!).\\nRegional growth snapshots\\n\\nRegionStand\u2011out markets2024\u202fto \u202f2025 net new devsWhat\u2019s fueling the boom\\n\\nAPACIndia, Japan, Indonesia,\xa0+13MGovernment skilling, AI\u2011assisted local\u2011language tooling.

(You can get more information about this in our methodology section.)\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe results of our analysis suggest India will continue to expand its lead, reaching 57.5 million developers by 2030, and accounting for more than one in three of all projected sign ups worldwide. The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\\nNotably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\\nKey takeaways\\nOne in every three new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn\u2019t in the global top 10 in 2020.\\nIndia alone added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth.\\nThe AI boom is global:\u202fThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\xa0\xa0\\nOpen source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source development reached record levels this year with 1.12 billion contributions across public repositories (+13% YoY). March 2025 marked the largest single month of new open source contributors in GitHub history: 255,000 first-timers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 395 million public repositories hosted 1.12 billion contributions and 518.7 million merged pull requests\u2014each a record.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s fastest\u2011growing projects by contributors\\nSix of the 10 fastest-growing repositories were AI infrastructure projects, underscoring demand for runtimes, orchestration, and efficiency tools.\\nStandards also saw big growth: Model Context Protocol (MCP) hit 37k stars in just eight months, though it\u2019s not on our lists below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top open source projects by contributors\\n2025\u2019s top projects split between AI infrastructure (vllm, ollama, huggingface/transformers) and enduring ecosystems (vscode, godot, home-assistant).\\nOn one side, projects like vllm, ollama, ragflow, llama.cpp, and huggingface/transformers dominate, confirming that contributors are investing in the foundation layers of AI\u2014model runtimes, inference engines, and orchestration frameworks.\\nOn the other side, mainstay ecosystems such as vscode, godot, expo, and home-assistant continue to attract steady contributor bases, showing that open source momentum extends well beyond AI.\\nThe takeaway?

AI infrastructure projects are prominent among top-growth repositories. When we zoom out to the top 20 projects (not all of these are captured in our above graphic), we see a few things at play:\xa0\\nReproducibility and dependency hygiene are hot. The rise of astral-sh/uv and NixOS/nixpkgs points to a hunger for deterministic builds, faster installs, and less \u201cworks on my machine.\u201d\\nPerformance-centric developer tools win attention. Ghostty, Tailwind CSS, and uv are all about speed, tight feedback loops, and minimal friction.\\nDevelopers are contributing to projects that emphasize privacy and control. Zen Browser and Clash-Verge reflect interest in privacy, content control, and routing around networks.\\nOpen source social media continues to grow. As one of the biggest social projects, Bluesky\u2019s momentum suggests developers are still investing in open protocols and portable identity.\\nAI, tinkering, and frontend projects attract first-time contributors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 20% of the most popular open source projects among first-time contributors in 2025 were AI-focused. But we\u2019re also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\xa0\\nMost of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure. Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\\nMajor platforms bring visibility. microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\\nfirstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\\nSmart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers. Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d\\nFrontend and dev tool projects also light up. shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\\nAI\u2011native vs. evergreen ecosystems\\nAI podium. Six of the overall top 10 projects by total contributors are AI\u2011centric (vllm, huggingface/transformers, modelcontextprotocol/servers, llama.cpp, etc.). They averaged +150\u202f% contributor growth YoY\u2014triple the OSS median.\\nEvergreen pull. Internet of things (home\u2011assistant), game development (godotengine/godot), and the Python language itself (cpython) still add thousands of contributors per quarter.\\nThe global landscape in open source activity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia now has the largest public and open source contributor base in the world. This reflects both the country\u2019s booming developer population and its increasing role in OSS adoption.\\nThe U.S. continues to lead in contributions. Despite having fewer contributors, U.S.-based developers contributed more to public and open source projects on GitHub. This suggests higher per-developer activity.\\nBrazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier. Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\\nCommunity health: Governance isn\u2019t keeping pace with developer activity\\n\u200b\u200bGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\xa0\\nREADME reach: ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\xa0\\nContributor guides: At 5.5%, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\\nCodes of Conduct: 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They\u2019re foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration. This guide to getting your repository collaboration-ready shares what documentation is most important for fostering a sense of shared ownership.\\nKey takeaways for 2025\\n395M public and open source repositories (+19% YoY)\\n1.12B public and open source contributions (+13% YoY)\\n518.7M pull requests merged (+29% YoY)\\n60% of top 10 open source projects by contributors are AI\u2011focused\\nOnly 1\u202fin\u202f50 repositories ships with a Code of Conduct\\nSecurity: from \u201cshift left\u201d to secure\u202fby\u202fdefault\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\xa0\\nAutomation is driving this acceleration. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving common OWASP Top 10 issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\xa0\\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories (+172% YoY). Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub\u2019s engineers published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow, which offers some valuable lessons).\xa0\\nAutomation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\\nDevelopers are automating more build, test, and security activity. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That\u2019s up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year\u2019s report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\\nAutomation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy. Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\\nMonthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. Only ~1\u202fin\u202f3 fixes ships within the same month it\u2019s proposed.\\nSecurity alerts follow the same pattern: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\\nFaster fix times\\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\xa0\xa0\\nConfiguring and codifying security\\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in dependabot.yml more than doubled this year (846k, +137% YoY), marking a shift from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cpatch me automatically, within guardrails.\u201d\\n\\nSignal2024 (cumulative)2025\u202f (cumulative)YoY\\n\\nRepositories with dependabot.yml356k846k+137%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken Access Control overcame Injection to become the top CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories. New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\\nThis points to a broader issue: authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs. Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same category became the fastest-growing target for Copilot Autofix. By mid-2025, developers were accepting AI-generated fixes for Broken Access Control in 6,000+ repositories per month. Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\\nOpenSSF Scorecard status: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the OpenSSF Scorecard via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\xa0\\nThe top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\\nMethodology note\\nUnless otherwise specified, year-over-year growth rates throughout this section reflect August 2025 vs. August 2024, a same-month year-over-year comparison used to control for seasonality in monthly contributor counts.\\nTypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\\nPython remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (\u2248403k repositories; +17.8% YoY inside AI-tagged projects).\\nJavaScript is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn\u2019t just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed in 2025\\n\\nRank 2025LanguageYoY contributor gainYoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)Big takeaway\\n\\n1TypeScript~1,054,01566.63%TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development.\\n2Python~850,57948.78%Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python\u2019s usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work.\xa0\\n3JavaScript~427,14824.79%Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript.\\n4Java~174,70520.73%Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth.\\n5C#~136,735\xa022.22%Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython still trails the combined JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, a continuation of last year\u2019s trend that highlights just how large the typed and untyped JavaScript community remains.\xa0\\nBut starting in 2025, Python\u2019s growth curve began to track almost identically in parallel with JavaScript and TypeScript, suggesting that AI adoption is influencing language choice across these ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat else we\u2019re seeing\\nPython dominates AI projects. It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\\nTyped > loosely typed. TypeScript\u2019s growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as \u201cJavaScript\u201d activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\\nEnterprise stacks endure. Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\\nLegacy experiments emerge.

Though not a language, Jupyter Notebooks grew 24.5% YoY, with exploratory LLM experiments and data analysis now generating new standalone repos rather than remaining siloed in monorepos.\\nPerformance and systems languages are rising with AI (but not evenly). C grew ~20.9% YoY and C++ grew ~11.8% YoY, reflecting demand for faster runtimes, inference engines, and hardware-optimized loops.\\n.NET stays strong. C# grew ~10.6% YoY, consistent with enterprise and game/tooling ecosystems. This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\\nThe languages powering AI development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython and Jupyter Notebook continue to anchor new AI projects, but the story this year is Python\u2019s growth. Python now powers nearly half of all new AI repositories (582,196; +50.7% YoY), underscoring its role as the backbone of applied AI work, from training and inference to orchestration and deployment. Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for experimentation (402,643; +17.8% YoY), but the shift toward Python codebases signals more projects moving out of prototypes and into production stacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end and app-layer languages grew sharply from smaller bases\u2014TypeScript +77.9% (85,746) and JavaScript +24.8% (88,023)\u2014mirroring the rise of demos, dashboards, and lightweight apps built around model endpoints. Shell scripts (+324%) emerged as the fastest riser, reflecting how teams codify eval harnesses, data prep, and deployment pipelines. And C++ crossed 7,800 repos (+11%), a steady reminder of its role in performance-critical inference engines, runtimes, and hardware-close systems.\\nWhy TypeScript won in 2025\\nBy the numbers. TypeScript finished #1 on GitHub in August 2025 with 2,636,006 monthly contributors (+1.05M YoY; +66.6%) and led new repositories.\xa0\\nTyped contracts scale AI-assisted teams. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch LLM errors before production.\\nFrameworks ship with TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate a TypeScript codebase by default (npm create, pnpm dlx, or bunx create).\xa0\\nTyped systems help identify LLM-generated compile errors earlier in the pipeline. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures.\xa0\\nLow barrier to entry. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and IDE autoconfig hide boilerplate, so junior devs can spin up typed stacks quickly.\\nGenerative\u202fAI and agentic workflows become ordinary engineering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year we saw AI move from experiment to mainstream. In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\xa0\\nAI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million, nearly doubling in less than two years.\\nRoughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week, showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly contributors to generative-AI projects climbed sharply across our measurement year. From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan\u2013Aug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan\u2013Aug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\\nKey takeaways:\xa0\\nGenerative AI is becoming infrastructure. More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August \u201825 vs. August \u201824), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\xa0\\nGrowth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping. Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\xa0\\nAI in open source. Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using GitHub Copilot.\\nEarly evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot. Python-based code accelerated mid-2025 while Notebook growth flattened\u2014signaling packaging into production. (By year\u2019s end, Notebooks rebounded, keeping pace with Python.)\\nStrong signals of mainstream appeal\xa0\\n\\nData pointWhy it matters\\n\\n178% YoY increase in projects that import an LLM SDK1.13M+ public repositories now import an LLM SDK; 693k+ were created in the last 12 months alone.Growth rates indicate a shift from early experimentation to sustained building.\\nContributors up >3X since 2023Monthly distinct contributors to AI repos rose from 68k (Jan 2024) to ~200k (Aug 2025). August 2025 is up 111% YoY vs. August 2024.AI work is no longer the domain of specialists.\\nMonthly contributions near 6MMonthly commits/contributions to AI projects reached ~6.0M (Aug 2025) hitting a peak of 6.28M (Jun 2025). August 2025 is up 188% YoY vs. August 2024.More code, more often, offering evidence of production-grade adoption and active iteration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScale replaces hype\\n1.13M+ public repositories now depend on generative-AI SDKs (up 178% YoY). More than 693k+ were created in the last 12 months, sharply outpacing 2024\u2019s total (~400,000). The compounding curve that began in early 2023 shows no sign of tapering; every week, on average, we are still seeing new all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho\u2019s shipping the code?\\nThe U.S. remains the largest source of contributions (~12.8M, 31.8%). India ranks second (~5M, 12.5%) and leads by distinct repositories (405k vs. 342k).\\nA second tier (Germany, Japan, U.K., Korea, Canada, Brazil, Spain, France) contributes another ~40%, globalizing the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgentic tools are now being adopted in day-to-day workflows\\nThis year, GitHub Copilot coding agent went from demo to GA and we\u2019re starting to see its impact.\\nA first glimpse of coding agent shows 1+ million pull requests that were created between May 2025 and September 2025.\\nWhere it\u2019s showing up:\\nA repository-level comparison of public repositories with \u22651 coding agent-authored pull request vs. a random sample without Copilot coding agent shows strong selection effects: coding agent activity is skewed toward repositories with more stars, larger size, and greater age. In other words, teams aren\u2019t only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they\u2019re trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\xa0\\nWe invite the community to run within-repository experiments (A/B or stepped-wedge) and matched analyses conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We\u2019ll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\xa0\\nAI is driving notable breakouts in open source\\nGenerative AI projects continue to be among GitHub\u2019s most popular. Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\xa0\\n\\nRepository (age \u22643 yrs unless noted)AI connection\\n\\nvllm-project/vllmOpen source vision-language model + training/inference stack\\nggml-org/llama.cppLocal Llama inference on CPU/GPU\\ninfiniflow/ragflowEnd-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template\\ncline/cline\u201cLLM-native\u201d command-line shell that reasons over local context\\nhuggingface/transformers (6.6 yrs)Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat this tells us\\nSoftware infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity. Brand-new generative AI repositories (\u2264 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\\nStandards are emerging in real time. The rapid rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\\nAI is reshaping classic tooling. Projects like ollama and ragflow show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\\nAI is helping developers fix code, too\\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\\nBroken access control surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in 6,000+ repositories per month by mid-2025.\\nSecurity logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\\nAutofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues\u2014not just exotic vulnerabilities\u2014bringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\\nHere\u2019s how to stay ahead\\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI\u2014systems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis\u2014is emerging.\\nExpect AI libraries to become \u201cplumbing.\u201d If your stack can\u2019t load a model or pipe context into one, you\u2019ll feel legacy-bound quickly.\xa0\\nGo beyond notebooks. Package your experiments early to share them with others.\\nWatch the toolchain, not just the models. The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today\u2019s fast-rising repositories.\\nBuild for interoperability. Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\\nTake this with you\\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn\u2019t replace developers\u2014it would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\\nThe past year marked historic milestones:\xa0\\nIndia overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub. It\u2019s also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\\nTypeScript became the most used language for the first time, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\\nOpen source remains the foundation. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\\nThe story of 2025 isn\u2019t AI versus developers. It\u2019s about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\\nGlossary\\n2025: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\xa0\\nYear-over-year language comparisons: Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\\nContributions: Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\xa0\\nContributors: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\xa0\\nDeveloper: Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries\u2014from software development to data analysis and design.\\nTotal repositories: The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\\nProgramming language usage: Unless otherwise noted, \u201cmost used\u201d languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for \u201cTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.\u201d\\nAI-related repository: Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d \u201cLLM\u201d) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\\nAgentic workflows: Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\\nCopilot coding agent: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment\u2014subject to developer review and approval.\\nCopilot code review: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\\nGitHub Actions minutes: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\\nCodeQL: GitHub\u2019s semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\\nMona rank: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final \u201cMona Rank\u201d based on the summed rank.\\nLLM SDK: A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\xa0\\nMethodology\\nScope & coverage\\nOctoverse year: Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025.\\nUnless noted, metrics reflect public activity only. Public indicators are also available on the GitHub Innovation Graph. For country-level reporting there, we publish metrics only when \u2265100 unique developers performed the activity in the period.\\nTime windows\\nMonthly snapshots: Calendar-month metrics to show peaks/turning points (e.g., Aug 2025 language rankings).\\nTrailing-12-month (T12): Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925 vs Sep \u201923\u2013Aug \u201924 for year-over-year trends/averages.\\nLonger lookbacks: Historical context from Jan 2022 \u2192 Aug 2025 where relevant.\\nUnits & entities\\nContributors/developers: Monthly unique users per metric (e.g., per language). One user can appear in multiple categories in the same month, so these do not sum across categories.\\nRepositories: Counted in a month if created or active, per metric definition.\\nActivities: \u201cpushes,\u201d \u201cpull requests created/merged,\u201d \u201ccomments,\u201d etc., follow standard GitHub event definitions.\\nGrowth baselines\\nSame-month YoY: Month vs. the same month prior year (e.g., Aug \u201925 vs Aug \u201924) are used for milestones/seasonality control as in language comparisons.\\nT12 YoY: Trailing-12-month total or average vs the prior trailing-12-month metric are used for sustained trends (e.g., average monthly contributors, pull requests per month).\\nStock vs. flow (cumulative metrics): Stock = level at a point in time (e.g., SDK repos as of Aug \u201925). Flow = adds over a window (e.g., Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925). Labeled distinctly.\\nGeography\\nDevelopers are mapped to countries via self-reported locations, standardized to ISO country codes; country aggregates observe the \u2265100 developers publication threshold.\\nRepository & language classification\\nPrimary language: GitHub language detection (e.g., Linguist); mixed-language repositories are attributed to one primary language.\\nNotebooks: \u201cJupyter Notebook\u201d is a development-environment classification and is labeled transparently.\\nAI projects: Identified via signals such as generative-AI SDK usage (imports/dependencies) and related metadata.\\nOpen source quality signals: Presence of files/policies (e.g., codes of conduct) from repository metadata.\\nStatistical techniques\\nMonthly time-series tracking; cumulative counts for stock growth; Top-N rankings (contributors, repo counts, growth rates, activity volumes).\\nMinimum thresholds to reduce noise (e.g., lists may require \u22651,000 contributors or \u2265X repos; metric-specific).\\nUser de-duplication\\nCount unique users per time period and per metric to avoid within-slice double counting; cross-category duplication is expected by design.\\nData quality controls\\nExclude incomplete months (e.g., the current month) from YoY/T12.\\nFilter bots/automation where identifiable (account flags + behavioral heuristics).\\nEnforce minimum activity for inclusion in growth and rankings.\\nCross-validate against multiple internal/public sources (e.g., Innovation Graph).\\nInterpretation & reproducibility\\nSeasonality: motivates same-month YoY for snapshots and T12 for structure.\\nAttribution: primary language is repository-level; TypeScript/JavaScript mixes may appear under one language.\\nScope: public-only views undercount private activity but preserve directionality.\\nPublic counterparts for several metrics can be verified via the Innovation Graph.\\nDeveloper growth projections\\nForecasting models: a collection of time-series and regression models that use historical data and statistics to predict future outcomes. Forecasting models relied on historical GitHub data, sign-up rates and product usage, as well as market-sizing information.\xa0\\nAccuracy of forecasts: No forecast is ever accurate. Backtesting shows models used for forecasting growth projections were within reasonable levels of accuracy (less than 30% Mean Absolute Percentage Error).\\nExternal factors: Forecasts do not take into account competitive landscape changes, geopolitical/economic conditions, or future covariates (product/feature releases that may shift responses differently from historical data).\\n\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"GitHub Staff","description":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91454","categories":["News & insights","Octoverse"],"isoDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1","publishedDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","author":"GitHub Staff","summary":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Jamie Cooper","title":"Announcing the 2025 GitHub Partner Award winners \ud83c\udf89","link":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-the-2025-github-partner-award-winners/","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\\">\\n<html><body><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-moving tech industry, partnerships are a powerful engine for scale.

Detection","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25802","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400","dc:creator":"Jayant Biradar, Smit Shah, Tanmay Naik","description":"arXiv:2510.25802v1 Announce Type: new \\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance cy- bersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and tem- poral dynamics through sequential analysis of network events.

It\u2019s your likes, reviews, comments, and all the little traces you didn\u2019t mean to share. Together, they paint a picture of you\u2014one that friends, employers, and yes, scammers can see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-step-1-nbsp-your-active-footprint\\">Step 1: &nbsp;Your active footprint</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your <strong>active footprint</strong> is everything you choose to share online. Every photo, product review, or status update you post adds another brushstroke to your online portrait. Over time, those choices form a public story about who you are\u2014your interests, values, and connections. That story shapes how people, employers, and even algorithms see you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-step-2-your-passive-footprint\\">Step 2: Your passive footprint</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your <strong>passive footprint</strong> is the quieter one\u2014the data you leave behind without meaning to. Every website you visit, every cookie that tracks your clicks, every photo that quietly tags its GPS location adds to it. These fragments often work in the background, invisible but persistent, quietly mapping your habits, preferences, and even your movements.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-you-step-in-more-stuff-than-you-think\\">You step in more stuff than you think</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your personal data is scattered in more places than you\u2019d expect. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok hold snapshots of your life and relationships. Government databases, company websites, and news mentions might hold your name or location. Forums, review sites, and shopping accounts keep their own records. And data brokers collect and sell huge bundles of personal details, sometimes packaging them into lists anyone can buy. Even if you\u2019ve never shared something directly, chances are it\u2019s already out there.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Alone, small details don\u2019t seem like much\u2014a nickname here, a photo there\u2014but stitched together they can reveal a lot. Your job title, home city, favorite restaurant, even your pet\u2019s name (a popular security question!) can help someone impersonate or target you. Combine that with info leaked in data breaches, and attackers can build an eerily complete version of you\u2014ready-made for scams or identity theft.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-scammers-collect-your-data\\">How scammers collect your data</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To stay safe, it helps to see the world the way a scammer does: your online details are puzzle pieces, and they\u2019re putting the picture together.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Scraping</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Attackers use automated tools to pull information from public pages across the internet. That can include your bio, job history, or photos from social media, or your name and email address from company websites and online forums. All technically \u201cpublic,\u201d but when combined, they create a full dossier of your online life.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Breaches</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When companies get hacked or fail to secure their databases, your data can spill into the open. Big names like Equifax, LinkedIn, and Yahoo have all been hit. Leaks like these often contain names, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords\u2014and once data hits the dark web, it can circulate for years. That\u2019s why old breaches can still come back to haunt you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Brokers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data brokers legally collect information from public records and commercial sources, then sell detailed profiles for advertising and risk scoring. On the dark web, things get murkier: stolen logins, payment info, and even full identity kits (\u201cfullz\u201d) are traded by criminals. You\u2019ll never meet these markets\u2014but your data might end up there anyway.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Social engineering</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social engineering is where information meets manipulation. Attackers blend the details they find\u2014your social posts, work info, or breached credentials\u2014to make scams feel real. They might impersonate your boss, your bank, or even <em>you</em>. These scams work because they sound familiar, borrowing the tone and timing of real interactions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-real-scams-that-use-the-victim-s-digital-footprint\\">Real scams that use the victim\u2019s digital footprint</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here are just a few examples of how personal content shared online\u2014even casually or lovingly\u2014can be reused in ways you&#8217;d never imagine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-ai-voice-scams-that-sound-heartbreakingly-real\\"><strong>AI voice scams that sound heartbreakingly real</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When a mother in the US received a call from her daughter saying she\u2019d been in a car accident and needed bail money, she didn\u2019t hesitate to help.

It\u2019s your likes, reviews, comments, and all the little traces you didn\u2019t mean to share. Together, they paint a picture of you\u2014one that friends, employers, and yes, scammers can see.\\nStep 1: \xa0Your active footprint\\nYour active footprint is everything you choose to share online. Every photo, product review, or status update you post adds another brushstroke to your online portrait. Over time, those choices form a public story about who you are\u2014your interests, values, and connections. That story shapes how people, employers, and even algorithms see you.\\nStep 2: Your passive footprint\\nYour passive footprint is the quieter one\u2014the data you leave behind without meaning to. Every website you visit, every cookie that tracks your clicks, every photo that quietly tags its GPS location adds to it. These fragments often work in the background, invisible but persistent, quietly mapping your habits, preferences, and even your movements.\\nYou step in more stuff than you think\\nYour personal data is scattered in more places than you\u2019d expect. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok hold snapshots of your life and relationships. Government databases, company websites, and news mentions might hold your name or location. Forums, review sites, and shopping accounts keep their own records. And data brokers collect and sell huge bundles of personal details, sometimes packaging them into lists anyone can buy. Even if you\u2019ve never shared something directly, chances are it\u2019s already out there.\\nAlone, small details don\u2019t seem like much\u2014a nickname here, a photo there\u2014but stitched together they can reveal a lot. Your job title, home city, favorite restaurant, even your pet\u2019s name (a popular security question!) can help someone impersonate or target you. Combine that with info leaked in data breaches, and attackers can build an eerily complete version of you\u2014ready-made for scams or identity theft.\\nHow scammers collect your data\\nTo stay safe, it helps to see the world the way a scammer does: your online details are puzzle pieces, and they\u2019re putting the picture together.\\nScraping\\nAttackers use automated tools to pull information from public pages across the internet. That can include your bio, job history, or photos from social media, or your name and email address from company websites and online forums. All technically \u201cpublic,\u201d but when combined, they create a full dossier of your online life.\\nBreaches\\nWhen companies get hacked or fail to secure their databases, your data can spill into the open. Big names like Equifax, LinkedIn, and Yahoo have all been hit. Leaks like these often contain names, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords\u2014and once data hits the dark web, it can circulate for years. That\u2019s why old breaches can still come back to haunt you.\\nBrokers\\nData brokers legally collect information from public records and commercial sources, then sell detailed profiles for advertising and risk scoring. On the dark web, things get murkier: stolen logins, payment info, and even full identity kits (\u201cfullz\u201d) are traded by criminals. You\u2019ll never meet these markets\u2014but your data might end up there anyway.\\nSocial engineering\\nSocial engineering is where information meets manipulation. Attackers blend the details they find\u2014your social posts, work info, or breached credentials\u2014to make scams feel real. They might impersonate your boss, your bank, or even you. These scams work because they sound familiar, borrowing the tone and timing of real interactions.\\nReal scams that use the victim\u2019s digital footprint\\nHere are just a few examples of how personal content shared online\u2014even casually or lovingly\u2014can be reused in ways you\u2019d never imagine.\\nAI voice scams that sound heartbreakingly real\\nWhen a mother in the US received a call from her daughter saying she\u2019d been in a car accident and needed bail money, she didn\u2019t hesitate to help. The voice on the other end sounded exactly like her, but it wasn\u2019t. It was an AI-generated clone.\\nScammers don\u2019t need much to pull this off\u2014just a few seconds of clear speech. That could come from a TikTok clip, a podcast snippet, a YouTube video, or even a Facebook post where your child\u2019s voice can be heard in the background. Once they have that audio, AI tools can replicate tone, emotion, and phrasing so accurately that even family members struggle to tell the difference.\\nThe Facebook photo that gives away your location\\nYou don\u2019t need to tag your location for someone to find you.

Official communications come from addresses like <code>service@paypal.com</code>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The email body itself was empty but came with a randomly named attachment\u2014two red flags in one.

Although it\u2019s a pretty straightforward attempt to lure targets into calling the scammers, it\u2019s worth writing up because it looks like it was sent out in bulk.\\nLet\u2019s look at the red flags.\\nFirstly, the sender address:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPayPal doesn\u2019t use Gmail addresses to send invoices, and they also don\u2019t put your address in the blind carbon copy (BCC) field. BCC hides the list of recipients, which is often a sign the email was sent to a large group.\\nAnd \u201cTina Pal\u201d must be Pay\u2019s evil twin\u2014one who doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s customary to address your customers by name rather than \u201cPayPal customer.\u201d\\nBecause the message came from a genuine Gmail address, the authentication results (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) all pass. That only proves the email wasn\u2019t spoofed and was sent from a legitimate Gmail server, not that it\u2019s actually from PayPal.\\nThe red flag here is that PayPal emails will not come from random Gmail addresses. Official communications come from addresses like service@paypal.com.\\nThe email body itself was empty but came with a randomly named attachment\u2014two red flags in one. PayPal would at least use some branding in the email and never expect their customers to open an attachment.\\nHere\u2019s what the invoice in the attachment looked like:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u201cPayPal Notification:\\nYour account has been billed $823.00. The payment will be processed in the next 24 hours. Didn\u2019t make this purchase? Contact PayPal Support right now.\u201d\\nMore red flags:\\nUrgency: \u201cThe payment will be processed in the next 24 hours\u201d or else the rather large amount of $823 is gone.\\nPhone number only: This isn\u2019t how you normally dispute PayPal charges. Genuine PayPal emails direct you to log in to your account or use their online Resolution Center, not to call a number.\\nUnverified number: Reverse lookup tools don\u2019t show it as PayPal\u2019s. Scammers often spoof phone numbers or register them under unrelated businesses. An official PayPal support number will appear on PayPal\u2019s website and be recognized by lookup tools.\\nBrand mismatch: An invoice comes from the company charging you, not from the payment provider. So, this one should have been branded for Geek Squad or be titled something like \u201cpayment notification.\u201d\\nWhat tech support scammers do\\nIn this type of tech support scam, the target calls the listed number, and the \u201ctech\u201d on the other end asks to remotely log in to their computer to check for \u201cviruses.\u201d They might run a short program to open command prompts and folders, just to scare and distract the victim. Then they\u2019ll ask to install another tool to \u201cfix\u201d things, which will search the computer for anything they can turn into money. Others will sell you  fake protection software and bill you for their services.

Thailand already has an active creative scene, and this launch is meant to support more visual storytelling from the region. The app&#8217;s rollout also includes Vietnam and Taiwan.</p>\\n<p>Sora first arrived in the US and Canada in early September, and many users there have already shared clips. The app has since passed one million downloads in under five days, according to a social media post by Sora head Bill Peebles, who noted that it reached that milestone even faster than ChatGPT did at launch, despite requiring users to be invited to use the app at launch.</p>\\n<p>People in Thailand can download the app for free on iOS with no invite code. For now, use limits are relatively generous, though those limits may change.</p>\\n<p>The app is powered by Sora 2, a video generation model that can produce &#8216;original&#8217; clips, remix existing creations, and suggest content through a personal feed. Users can also appear directly inside scenes through a feature called Cameos, which requires a one-time check to confirm identity and likeness. The app supports Thai language input.</p>\\n<p>Cameos have quickly become a popular feature among early testers as they offer a playful way to interact and connect with friends. Thai creator Woody Milintachinda said, &#8220;Sora allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that immediately resonates with audiences. They can see and feel the story unfold. It has also given me a unique platform to share my experiences with a wide community of creators and storytellers not just in Thailand but the world, inspiring new forms of connection and creativity. With Sora, the creative possibilities truly feel limitless.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To go with this release, the app now includes Character Cameos, with which users can turn nearly anything into a reusable character, such as a pet, drawing, personal item, or original design created inside Sora. After uploading a video of the character, users can assign permissions that are separate from their personal likeness. That character can stay private, be shared only with followers, or be opened to everyone on the platform. Once named, the character can appear in any future video.</p>\\n<p>To mark the Halloween season, the app launches with a starter pack that includes classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, Ghost, Witch, and Jack-O-Lantern.</p>\\n<p>The company says it plans to bring Sora to Thailand with responsibility in mind. The feed is designed to encourage creation rather than passive viewing, aimed at accounts users follow. The aim is not to increase screen time but to spark creative output, the company states.</p>\\n<p>Users can keep control of their likeness when using Cameos, deciding who can use it, and the account holder can remove access or take down any video that includes their likeness at any time. Videos made with a cameo of the user created by someone else remain visible to the user.</p>\\n<p>Videos produced in Sora include a visible, animated watermark and an invisible C2PA digital watermark.

Thailand already has an active creative scene, and this launch is meant to support more visual storytelling from the region. The app\u2019s rollout also includes Vietnam and Taiwan.\\nSora first arrived in the US and Canada in early September, and many users there have already shared clips. The app has since passed one million downloads in under five days, according to a social media post by Sora head Bill Peebles, who noted that it reached that milestone even faster than ChatGPT did at launch, despite requiring users to be invited to use the app at launch.\\nPeople in Thailand can download the app for free on iOS with no invite code. For now, use limits are relatively generous, though those limits may change.\\nThe app is powered by Sora 2, a video generation model that can produce \u2018original\u2019 clips, remix existing creations, and suggest content through a personal feed. Users can also appear directly inside scenes through a feature called Cameos, which requires a one-time check to confirm identity and likeness. The app supports Thai language input.\\nCameos have quickly become a popular feature among early testers as they offer a playful way to interact and connect with friends. Thai creator Woody Milintachinda said, \u201cSora allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that immediately resonates with audiences. They can see and feel the story unfold. It has also given me a unique platform to share my experiences with a wide community of creators and storytellers not just in Thailand but the world, inspiring new forms of connection and creativity. With Sora, the creative possibilities truly feel limitless.\u201d\\nTo go with this release, the app now includes Character Cameos, with which users can turn nearly anything into a reusable character, such as a pet, drawing, personal item, or original design created inside Sora. After uploading a video of the character, users can assign permissions that are separate from their personal likeness. That character can stay private, be shared only with followers, or be opened to everyone on the platform. Once named, the character can appear in any future video.\\nTo mark the Halloween season, the app launches with a starter pack that includes classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein\u2019s monster, Ghost, Witch, and Jack-O-Lantern.\\nThe company says it plans to bring Sora to Thailand with responsibility in mind. The feed is designed to encourage creation rather than passive viewing, aimed at accounts users follow. The aim is not to increase screen time but to spark creative output, the company states.\\nUsers can keep control of their likeness when using Cameos, deciding who can use it, and the account holder can remove access or take down any video that includes their likeness at any time. Videos made with a cameo of the user created by someone else remain visible to the user.\\nVideos produced in Sora include a visible, animated watermark and an invisible C2PA digital watermark. The hidden version cannot be added to content that was not created in Sora, helping confirm which clips were created on the platform.\\nFor teens, the app applies daily limits on how many generated videos appear in their feed. Cameos also come with stricter rules for this demographic. Safety systems exist, and human moderators can review bullying cases. Parents can use ChatGPT-based controls to adjust feed limits, turn off personalisation, and manage direct message settings.\\n(Photo by Mariia Shalabaieva)\\nSee also: OpenAI unveils open-weight AI safety models for developers\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor recovery reflects calculated strategic pivots made during its downturn, market dynamics that finally shifted in its favour, and intense competitive pressures that forced the company to accelerate its AI chip roadmap.</p>\\n<h3>The road back from the slump</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s journey to this quarter&#8217;s performance began in a different place. Throughout 2024 and into early 2025, the company faced multiple headwinds: a brutal memory chip glut that collapsed prices, delayed qualification of its HBM products with key customers, and the company seeing rival SK Hynix capture early leadership in AI memory chips.</p>\\n<p>The low point came in the second quarter of 2025, when Samsung&#8217;s chip division reported operating profit that had analysts questioning whether the company had lost its technological edge. SK Hynix had seized the top spot in the memory market for the first time, fueled by its early success supplying HBM chips to Nvidia&#8217;s AI accelerators.</p>\\n<p>MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, <a href=\\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/samsumg-reclaims-global-memory-market-top-spot-in-Q3-2025-driven-by-robust-dram-nand-demand\\">contextualised</a> Samsung&#8217;s third-quarter performance as &#8220;a clear result of a broader memory market boom and rising prices for general-purpose memory.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>But Hwang&#8217;s firm also noted that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market from SK Hynix during Q3, suggesting the semiconductor recovery involved more than just favourable market conditions.</p>\\n<h3>HBM: From laggard to mass production</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s ability to reverse its HBM fortunes proved central to the turnaround. The company confirmed that HBM3E is now &#8220;in mass production and being sold to all related customers,&#8221; while HBM4 samples are &#8220;simultaneously being shipped to key clients.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Reports emerged in late September that Samsung had passed Nvidia&#8217;s qualification tests for advanced high-bandwidth memory chips \u2013 a important milestone that had eluded the company for months.

Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>That supply-demand imbalance has created pricing power that Samsung lacked during its declining quarters. The company specifically cited &#8220;a favourable price environment&#8221; and &#8220;notably reduced one-off costs like inventory value adjustments&#8221; as contributors to higher profits.</p>\\n<h3>Beyond memory: Foundry progress and challenges</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor recovery extended beyond memory chips. The Foundry Business, which manufactures chips designed by other companies, &#8220;posted a significant improvement in earnings in Q3 2025, stemming from a reduction in one-off costs and better fab use.&#8221; The division also achieved &#8220;record-high customer orders, mainly on advanced nodes.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The foundry business is ramping up mass production of 2-nanometer Gate-All-Around (GAA) products, an important technology that helps maintain competitiveness against TSMC, the company that dominates the foundry market. Samsung indicated it would begin operations at its fab in Taylor, Texas, &#8220;in a timely manner&#8221; in 2026.</p>\\n<p>However, the System LSI Business, which designs Samsung&#8217;s Exynos processors and image sensors, saw earnings stall &#8220;due to seasonality and customer inventory adjustments.&#8221;</p>\\n<h3>What this means for 2026</h3>\\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s guidance for the coming year reflects confidence that the semiconductor recovery has staying power. The Memory Business will &#8220;focus on the mass production of HBM4 products with differentiated performance&#8221; while aiming to &#8220;scale out the HBM sales base.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The company plans capacity expansion in its 1c manufacturing process to meet projected HBM4 demand increases. Consolidated revenue for the quarter reached KRW 86.1 trillion, a 15.4% increase from the previous quarter and 8.85% higher year-over-year. The Device eXperience division, which includes smartphones, contributed KRW 34.1 trillion in revenue, supported by the Galaxy Z Fold7 launch and strong flagship sales.</p>\\n<p>Yet challenges persist. Samsung Display reported solid performance with KRW 8.1 trillion in revenue and KRW 1.2 trillion in operating profit, but the Visual Display business recorded an operating loss of KRW 0.1 trillion despite &#8220;solid sales growth of premium products,&#8221; citing &#8220;intensified competition.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The semiconductor recovery that Samsung achieved in Q3 2025 resolves the immediate crisis that threatened its market position. Whether the company can sustain this momentum while navigating intense competition from SK Hynix in HBM, TSMC in foundry, and emerging geopolitical pressures on the chip industry will determine if this quarter marked a true turning point or merely a reprieve.</p>\\n<p>For now, Samsung has demonstrated that even after four quarters of decline, strategic execution and market timing can still produce a comeback.</p>\\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\\"https://unsplash.com/@babak20\\">Babak Habibi</a>)</em></p>\\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/samsung-ai-strategy-delivers-record-revenue-despite-semiconductor-headwinds/\\">Samsung AI strategy delivers record revenue despite semiconductor headwinds</a></strong></p>\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\\"><img fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"728\\" height=\\"90\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-11.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-110128\\" srcset=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-11.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-11-300x37.png 300w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\" /></a></figure>\\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out<a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-72438\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png\\" alt=\\"Image credit: vxdb\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"415\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png 1421w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-768x425.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-782x433.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /></p>\\n<p>First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> &#8212; the biggest attack that <strong>Google</strong> had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p>\\n<p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote <strong>Roland Dobbins</strong>, principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>, in a recent <a href=\\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p>\\n<p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;<strong>residential proxy</strong>&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-31323\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"631\\" height=\\"264\\" /></p>\\n<p>From a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>\\n<p>And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH</h2>\\n<p><strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> is co-founder of <a href=\\"https://spur.us\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:</p>\\n<p>AUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097<br />\\nRAYOBYTE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 43,894<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa043,008<br />\\nWEBSHARE_PROXY\xa0 \xa039,800<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 32,723<br />\\nPROXYCHEAP_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,368<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,202<br />\\nMYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY\xa0 25,287<br />\\nHYPE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 18,185<br />\\nMASSIVE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 17,152</p>\\n<p>Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;</p>\\n<p>LUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421<br />\\nNETNUT_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 10,982,458<br />\\nABCPROXY_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 9,294,419<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa06,754,790<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa03,209,313<br />\\nEARNFM_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,659,913<br />\\nNODEMAVEN_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,627,851<br />\\nINFATICA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,335,194<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,032,027<br />\\nYILU_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 1,549,155<span id=\\"more-72424\\"></span></p>\\n<p>Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bright Data</strong> was formerly known as <strong>Luminati Networks</strong>, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said <strong>Rony Shalit</strong>, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and <a href=\\"https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a robust opt-in only residential peers</a>, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>HK NETWORK</h2>\\n<p>Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.</p>\\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\\"https://synthient.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Synthient</a>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own <strong>software development kit</strong> or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is <em>forced to install</em> some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p>\\n<p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies.

That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p>\\n<p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqleft\\">&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said.</span> &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p>\\n<p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">report</a> earlier this year from <strong>LibreNews</strong> found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">pay-per-crawl</a>&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p>\\n<p>On October 22, the social media and news network <strong>Reddit</strong> <a href=\\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Denas Grybauskas</strong>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p>\\n<p>In July, Google filed <a href=\\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME</h2>\\n<p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name <strong>fuckbriankrebs[.]com</strong>. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; and was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>\\n<p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72457\\" style=\\"width: 745px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72457 \\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"735\\" height=\\"707\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.\\n\\nFirst identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru\u2019s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.\\nIn June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second \u2014 the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru\u2019s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second \u2014 well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.\\nThese digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.\\n\u201cMultiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. \u201cOutbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.\u201d\\nThe incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru\u2019s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world\u2019s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.\\nExperts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else\u2019s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.\\n\\nFrom a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.\\nAnd as we\u2019ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.\\n\u2018INSANE\u2019 GROWTH\\nRiley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months \u2014 with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.\\n\u201cI just checked, and in the last 90 days we\u2019ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cThat is insane. That is so high of a number, it\u2019s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.\u201d\\nTo put Kilmer\u2019s comments in perspective, here was Spur\u2019s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:\\nAUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097\\nToday, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;\\nLUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421\\n\\nReached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur\u2019s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\\nBright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur\u2019s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur\u2019s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.\\n\u201cWe did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data\u2019s in some way,\u201d said Rony Shalit, Bright Data\u2019s chief compliance and ethics officer. \u201cIn many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.\u201d\\n\u201cOur network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,\u201d Shalit continued. \u201cEvery DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.\u201d\\nHK NETWORK\\nEven Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.\\nBenjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it\u2019s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What\u2019s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.\\nBrundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user\u2019s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.\\n\u201cProxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.\u201d\\nMany SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.\\nDepending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time \u2014 all maintained through other means, Brundage said.\\n\u201cOften, you\u2019ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.\u201d\\nSome proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider\u2019s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he\u2019d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.\\nBrundage says that by almost any measurement, the world\u2019s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur\u2019s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.\xa0Spur\u2019s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy\xa0(#10) as IPidea.\\nBrundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as \u201cHK Network.\u201d\\n\u201cThe way it works is there\u2019s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, \u2018Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we\u2019ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'\u201d Brundage explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.\u201d\\n\\nA graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.\\n\\nThose apps include a range of low-cost and \u201cfree\u201d virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user\u2019s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.\\n\u201cThey have all this bandwidth to offload,\u201d Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. \u201cAnd they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.\u201d\\nOne of IPidea\u2019s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy\u2019s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company\u2019s servers were massively hacked.\\nThat 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.\\n\\nThe website for 922Proxy.\\n\\nDATA SCRAPING FOR AI\\nIn recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That\u2019s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to block, because there\u2019s a risk of blocking real people,\u201d Spur\u2019s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.\\nKilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.\\n\u201cWeb crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cEverybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.\u201d\\nKilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.\\n\u201cWhere the cost of data is out of reach \u2014 there is some exclusivity or reason they can\u2019t access the data \u2014 they\u2019ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,\u201d Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.\\nAggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.\\nCloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company\u2019s \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.\\nOn October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.\\n\u201cRecognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThey do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.\u201d\\nDenas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.\\n\u201cReddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,\u201d Grybauskas said in a written statement. \u201cOxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.\u201d\\nAs big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.\\nIn July, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet\u2019s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet \u201ccompromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android\u2019s open-source software, which lacks Google\u2019s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.\u201d\\nA FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME\\nBrundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate \u201cscrew you\u201d to this site\u2019s author: One of the botnet\u2019s alleged partners goes by the handle \u201cForky,\u201d and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nBrundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru\u2019s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a \u201ckill switch\u201d capable of disrupting the botnet\u2019s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.\\n\\nA tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.\\n\\nFor one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d for the security intelligence company Seralys.\\nCaturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.\\nBut even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.\\n\u201cThe bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,\u201d he said. \u201cSo anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.\u201d\\n\\nCaturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.\\n\\nThe domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was used to spread malicious software by the Cutwail spam botnet. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by Russkill (a.k.a. \u201cDirt Jumper\u201d).\\nDomaintools.com finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to David \u201cAbdilo\u201d Crees, a 27-year-old Australian man sentenced in May 2025 to time served for cybercrime convictions related to the Lizard Squad hacking group.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/#comments","description":"Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic.

At GitHub, we\u2019ve always worked to solve these kinds of systemic challenges\u2014by making Git accessible, code review systematic with pull requests, and automating deployment with Actions.\xa0\\nWith 180 million developers, GitHub is growing at its fastest rate ever\u2014a new developer joining every second. What\u2019s more, 80% of new developers are using Copilot in their first week. AI isn\u2019t just a tool anymore; it\u2019s an integral part of the development experience. Our responsibility is to ensure this new era of collaboration is powerful, secure, and seamlessly integrated into the workflow you already trust.\\nAt GitHub Universe, we\u2019re announcing Agent HQ, GitHub\u2019s vision for the next evolution of our platform. Agents shouldn\u2019t be bolted on. They should work the way you already work. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making agents native to the GitHub flow.\\nAgent HQ transforms GitHub into an open ecosystem that unites every agent on a single platform. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, xAI, and more will become available directly within GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo bring this vision to life, we\u2019re shipping a suite of new capabilities built on the primitives you trust. This starts with a mission control, a single command center to assign, steer, and track the work of multiple agents from anywhere. It extends to VS Code with new ways to plan and customize agent behavior. And it is backed by enterprise-grade functionality: a new generation of agentic code review, a dedicated control plane to govern AI access and agent behavior, and a metrics dashboard to understand the impact of AI on your work.\xa0\\nWe are also deeply committed to investing in our platform and strengthening the primitives you rely on every day. This new world of development is powered by that foundational work, and we look forward to sharing more updates.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s dive in.\\nIn this post\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nIncreased confidence and control for your team\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\xa0\xa0\\nThe future is about giving you the power to orchestrate a fleet of specialized agents to perform complex tasks in parallel, not juggling a patchwork of disconnected tools or relying on a single agent. As the pioneer of asynchronous collaboration, we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to make sure these next-generation async tools just work.\xa0\\nWith Agent HQ what\u2019s not changing is just as important as what is. You\u2019re still working with the primitives you know\u2014Git, pull requests, issues\u2014and using your preferred compute, whether that\u2019s GitHub Actions or self-hosted runners. You\u2019re accessing agents through your existing paid Copilot subscription.\xa0\\nOn top of that foundation, we\u2019re opening the doors to a new world of capability. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI will be available on GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\nDon\u2019t want to wait? Starting this week, Copilot Pro+ users can begin working with \xa0OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders, the first of our partner agents to extend beyond its native surfaces and directly into the editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nThe power of Agent HQ comes from mission control, a unified command center that follows you wherever you work. It\u2019s not a single destination; it\u2019s a consistent interface across GitHub, VS Code, mobile, and the CLI that lets you direct, monitor, and manage every AI-driven task. With mission control, you can choose from a fleet of agents, assign them work in parallel, and track their progress from any device.\xa0\\nWe\u2019re also providing:\xa0\\nNew branch controls that give you granular oversight over when to run CI and other checks for agent-created code.\\nIdentity features to control which agent is building the task, managing access, and policies just like you would with any other developer on your team.\\nOne-click merge conflict resolution, improved file navigation, and better code commenting capabilities.\\nNew integrations for Slack and Linear, on top of our recently announced connections for Atlassian Jira, Microsoft Teams and Azure Boards, and Raycast.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTry mission control today.\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nMission control is in VS Code, too, so you\u2019ve got a single view of all your agents running in VS Code, in the Copilot CLI, or on GitHub.\\nToday\u2019s brand new release in VS Code is all about working alongside agents on projects, and it\u2019s not surprising that great results start with a great plan. Getting the context right before a project is critical, but that same context needs to carry through into the work. Copilot already adapts to the way your team works by learning from your files and your project\u2019s culture, but sometimes you need more pointed context.\\nSo today, we\u2019re introducing Plan Mode, which works with Copilot, and asks you clarifying questions along the way, to help you to build a step-by-step approach for your task. Providing the context upfront improves what Copilot can do and helps you find gaps, missing decisions, or project deficiencies early in the process\u2014before any code is written. Once you approve, your plan goes to Copilot to start implementing, whether that\u2019s locally in VS Code or using an agent in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor even finer control, you can now create custom agents in VS Code with AGENTS.md files, source-controlled documents that let you set clear rules and guardrails such as \u201cprefer this logger\u201d or \u201cuse table-driven tests for all handlers.\u201d This shapes Copilot\u2019s behavior without you re-prompting it every time.\\nNow you can rely on the new GitHub MCP Registry, available directly in VS Code.

Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub</strong>. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>AI is reshaping choices, not just code. </strong>In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that&rsquo;s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And one of the biggest things in 2025? <strong>Agents are here.</strong> Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we&rsquo;re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128161; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a visual learner, we have you covered.&#128071;</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\"><div class=\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\">\\n<iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" title=\\"Octoverse 2025: AI, India, and the new #1 programming language\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"281\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-u6dUg6IJk?feature=oembed\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\\">The state&#8239;of&#8239;GitHub in&#8239;2025: A year of record growth</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1152\\" height=\\"288\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288\\" alt=\\"Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91477\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1152 1152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1024 1024w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million.

Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in <strong>151k+ repositories (+172% YoY).</strong> Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub&rsquo;s engineers <a href=\\"https://github.blog/security/web-application-security/inside-github-how-we-hardened-our-saml-implementation/\\">published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow</a>, which offers some valuable lessons).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"automation-is-working-until-the-merge-queue-stalls\\">Automation is working (until the merge queue stalls)</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Developers are automating more build, test, and security activity.</strong> In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free.

Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub\u2014over 36 million in the past year. It\u2019s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.\xa0\\nThe release of GitHub Copilot Free in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged 43.2 million pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)\u2014including a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\xa0\\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s data highlights three key shifts:\xa0\\nGenerative\u202fAI is now standard in development. More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug \u201825 vs. Aug \u201824). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn\u2019t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is reshaping choices, not just code. In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that\u2019s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? Agents are here. Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we\u2019re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s jump in.\\n\ud83d\udca1 Oh, and if you\u2019re a visual learner, we have you covered.\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state\u202fof\u202fGitHub in\u202f2025: A year of record growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\\nSo, what does \u201cmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average\u201d actually mean?\xa0\\nDevelopers are converging on GitHub. More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\xa0\\nAI adoption starts immediately. We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use GitHub Copilot within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\xa0\\nThe talent boom is geographically diverse. Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\xa0\\nGitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of Copilot Free in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub\u2019s dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\\n\\n2025\u2011YTD lensContributionsShare of totalWhat it signals\\n\\nPrivate repositories4.97B\u2248\u202f81.5%Enterprise and team\u2011level collaboration is happening on GitHub.\xa0\\nPublic repositories1.12B\u2248\u202f18.5%The volume of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey numbers\\n180M+ developers are now on GitHub\\n630M total repositories with +121M new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\\n+58M private repositories (up \u202f33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\xa0\\nOpen source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub. 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\\nDeveloper productivity: shipping more, waiting less\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following the SPACE framework (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year\u2019s data.\\nDeveloper activity reached record levels in 2025\\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\\n\\nActivity2024 monthly average2025 monthly average\\n\\nIssues closed\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4M4.25M\\nPull requests merged\u202f35M43.2M\\nCode pushes65M82.19M\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the preview of Copilot coding agent in March and the introduction of Copilot code review in April. In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\xa0\\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\\nPull requests created: +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\\nIssues created: +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\\nComments on issues/PRs: essentially flat (+0.35%)\\nComments on commits: down -27% (sharp decline)\\nThese are observational signals rather than causal claims and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks and Dockerfiles highlight two stages of modern development\\nNotebooks are now a mature tool for experimentation, while Dockerfiles are considered the bridge to reproducibility and production. In 2025, 2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY) and 1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY). This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\\n\\nRepositories in\u202f2024Repositories in\u202f2025Delta\\n\\nJupyter Notebook present\u202f1.4M2.42M\xa0+75%\\nDockerfile present\u202f875k1.9M+120%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents enter the mainstream\\nAI code\u202freview helps developers.

Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\xa0\\nWhat about vibe coding?\xa0\\nOne notable trend in 2025 was \u201cvibe coding.\u201d First coined by Andrej Karparthy, vibe coding emerged as shorthand for a developer workflow that starts with an idea and jumps straight to a runnable proof-of-concept (often in a single evening, powered by AI autocompletion and copy-pastable cloud tooling).\xa0\\nIt might sound playful, but its implications are serious: if AI-assisted tools continue to lower the barrier to entry, we could see programming literacy expand dramatically. We\u2019ll be watching this space for bigger signals in the months and years to come.\\nWhere the world codes\u202fin\u202f2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last five years have redrawn not just GitHub\u2019s developer map, but also the distribution of global activity, faster than any period on record.\\nA new global top\u202f10\\nIndia added more than 5.2 million developers in 2025, which accounts for a little over 14% of GitHub\u2019s total +36 million new developers in 2025. That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\\n* Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) computed from raw counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed?\\nSignificant growth came from India, Brazil, and Indonesia. These regions combine large, young developer populations with expanding internet access and booming startup ecosystems. Many are also seeing some of the fastest growth in AI-related projects, as local companies adopt new tools to compete globally.\\nOver the past five years (from 2020 to 2025), India, Brazil, and Indonesia have more than quadrupled the number of developers on the platform; Japan and Germany have more than tripled their developer numbers; and the USA, UK, and Canada have more than doubled the number of developers on the platform.\\nBrazil, in particular, is benefiting from activity investment in fintech and open banking.\\nIndonesia continues to grow with its rise as Southeast Asia\u2019s digital powerhouse (it accounts for nearly half the region\u2019s online economy!).\\nRegional growth snapshots\\n\\nRegionStand\u2011out markets2024\u202fto \u202f2025 net new devsWhat\u2019s fueling the boom\\n\\nAPACIndia, Japan, Indonesia,\xa0+13MGovernment skilling, AI\u2011assisted local\u2011language tooling.

The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\\nNotably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\\nKey takeaways\\nOne in every three new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn\u2019t in the global top 10 in 2020.\\nIndia alone added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth.\\nThe AI boom is global:\u202fThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\xa0\xa0\\nOpen source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source development reached record levels this year with 1.12 billion contributions across public repositories (+13% YoY). March 2025 marked the largest single month of new open source contributors in GitHub history: 255,000 first-timers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 395 million public repositories hosted 1.12 billion contributions and 518.7 million merged pull requests\u2014each a record.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s fastest\u2011growing projects by contributors\\nSix of the 10 fastest-growing repositories were AI infrastructure projects, underscoring demand for runtimes, orchestration, and efficiency tools.\\nStandards also saw big growth: Model Context Protocol (MCP) hit 37k stars in just eight months, though it\u2019s not on our lists below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top open source projects by contributors\\n2025\u2019s top projects split between AI infrastructure (vllm, ollama, huggingface/transformers) and enduring ecosystems (vscode, godot, home-assistant).\\nOn one side, projects like vllm, ollama, ragflow, llama.cpp, and huggingface/transformers dominate, confirming that contributors are investing in the foundation layers of AI\u2014model runtimes, inference engines, and orchestration frameworks.\\nOn the other side, mainstay ecosystems such as vscode, godot, expo, and home-assistant continue to attract steady contributor bases, showing that open source momentum extends well beyond AI.\\nThe takeaway?

AI infrastructure projects are prominent among top-growth repositories. When we zoom out to the top 20 projects (not all of these are captured in our above graphic), we see a few things at play:\xa0\\nReproducibility and dependency hygiene are hot. The rise of astral-sh/uv and NixOS/nixpkgs points to a hunger for deterministic builds, faster installs, and less \u201cworks on my machine.\u201d\\nPerformance-centric developer tools win attention. Ghostty, Tailwind CSS, and uv are all about speed, tight feedback loops, and minimal friction.\\nDevelopers are contributing to projects that emphasize privacy and control. Zen Browser and Clash-Verge reflect interest in privacy, content control, and routing around networks.\\nOpen source social media continues to grow. As one of the biggest social projects, Bluesky\u2019s momentum suggests developers are still investing in open protocols and portable identity.\\nAI, tinkering, and frontend projects attract first-time contributors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 20% of the most popular open source projects among first-time contributors in 2025 were AI-focused. But we\u2019re also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\xa0\\nMost of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure. Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\\nMajor platforms bring visibility. microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\\nfirstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\\nSmart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers. Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d\\nFrontend and dev tool projects also light up. shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\\nAI\u2011native vs. evergreen ecosystems\\nAI podium. Six of the overall top 10 projects by total contributors are AI\u2011centric (vllm, huggingface/transformers, modelcontextprotocol/servers, llama.cpp, etc.). They averaged +150\u202f% contributor growth YoY\u2014triple the OSS median.\\nEvergreen pull. Internet of things (home\u2011assistant), game development (godotengine/godot), and the Python language itself (cpython) still add thousands of contributors per quarter.\\nThe global landscape in open source activity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia now has the largest public and open source contributor base in the world. This reflects both the country\u2019s booming developer population and its increasing role in OSS adoption.\\nThe U.S. continues to lead in contributions. Despite having fewer contributors, U.S.-based developers contributed more to public and open source projects on GitHub. This suggests higher per-developer activity.\\nBrazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier. Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\\nCommunity health: Governance isn\u2019t keeping pace with developer activity\\n\u200b\u200bGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\xa0\\nREADME reach: ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\xa0\\nContributor guides: At 5.5%, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\\nCodes of Conduct: 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They\u2019re foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration. This guide to getting your repository collaboration-ready shares what documentation is most important for fostering a sense of shared ownership.\\nKey takeaways for 2025\\n395M public and open source repositories (+19% YoY)\\n1.12B public and open source contributions (+13% YoY)\\n518.7M pull requests merged (+29% YoY)\\n60% of top 10 open source projects by contributors are AI\u2011focused\\nOnly 1\u202fin\u202f50 repositories ships with a Code of Conduct\\nSecurity: from \u201cshift left\u201d to secure\u202fby\u202fdefault\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\xa0\\nAutomation is driving this acceleration. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving common OWASP Top 10 issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\xa0\\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories (+172% YoY). Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub\u2019s engineers published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow, which offers some valuable lessons).\xa0\\nAutomation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\\nDevelopers are automating more build, test, and security activity. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That\u2019s up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year\u2019s report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\\nAutomation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy. Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\\nMonthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. Only ~1\u202fin\u202f3 fixes ships within the same month it\u2019s proposed.\\nSecurity alerts follow the same pattern: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\\nFaster fix times\\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\xa0\xa0\\nConfiguring and codifying security\\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in dependabot.yml more than doubled this year (846k, +137% YoY), marking a shift from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cpatch me automatically, within guardrails.\u201d\\n\\nSignal2024 (cumulative)2025\u202f (cumulative)YoY\\n\\nRepositories with dependabot.yml356k846k+137%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken Access Control overcame Injection to become the top CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories. New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\\nThis points to a broader issue: authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs. Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same category became the fastest-growing target for Copilot Autofix. By mid-2025, developers were accepting AI-generated fixes for Broken Access Control in 6,000+ repositories per month. Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\\nOpenSSF Scorecard status: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the OpenSSF Scorecard via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\xa0\\nThe top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\\nMethodology note\\nUnless otherwise specified, year-over-year growth rates throughout this section reflect August 2025 vs. August 2024, a same-month year-over-year comparison used to control for seasonality in monthly contributor counts.\\nTypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\\nPython remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (\u2248403k repositories; +17.8% YoY inside AI-tagged projects).\\nJavaScript is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn\u2019t just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed in 2025\\n\\nRank 2025LanguageYoY contributor gainYoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)Big takeaway\\n\\n1TypeScript~1,054,01566.63%TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development.\\n2Python~850,57948.78%Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python\u2019s usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work.\xa0\\n3JavaScript~427,14824.79%Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript.\\n4Java~174,70520.73%Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth.\\n5C#~136,735\xa022.22%Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython still trails the combined JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, a continuation of last year\u2019s trend that highlights just how large the typed and untyped JavaScript community remains.\xa0\\nBut starting in 2025, Python\u2019s growth curve began to track almost identically in parallel with JavaScript and TypeScript, suggesting that AI adoption is influencing language choice across these ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat else we\u2019re seeing\\nPython dominates AI projects. It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\\nTyped > loosely typed. TypeScript\u2019s growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as \u201cJavaScript\u201d activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\\nEnterprise stacks endure. Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\\nLegacy experiments emerge.

Though not a language, Jupyter Notebooks grew 24.5% YoY, with exploratory LLM experiments and data analysis now generating new standalone repos rather than remaining siloed in monorepos.\\nPerformance and systems languages are rising with AI (but not evenly). C grew ~20.9% YoY and C++ grew ~11.8% YoY, reflecting demand for faster runtimes, inference engines, and hardware-optimized loops.\\n.NET stays strong. C# grew ~10.6% YoY, consistent with enterprise and game/tooling ecosystems. This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\\nThe languages powering AI development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython and Jupyter Notebook continue to anchor new AI projects, but the story this year is Python\u2019s growth. Python now powers nearly half of all new AI repositories (582,196; +50.7% YoY), underscoring its role as the backbone of applied AI work, from training and inference to orchestration and deployment. Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for experimentation (402,643; +17.8% YoY), but the shift toward Python codebases signals more projects moving out of prototypes and into production stacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end and app-layer languages grew sharply from smaller bases\u2014TypeScript +77.9% (85,746) and JavaScript +24.8% (88,023)\u2014mirroring the rise of demos, dashboards, and lightweight apps built around model endpoints. Shell scripts (+324%) emerged as the fastest riser, reflecting how teams codify eval harnesses, data prep, and deployment pipelines. And C++ crossed 7,800 repos (+11%), a steady reminder of its role in performance-critical inference engines, runtimes, and hardware-close systems.\\nWhy TypeScript won in 2025\\nBy the numbers. TypeScript finished #1 on GitHub in August 2025 with 2,636,006 monthly contributors (+1.05M YoY; +66.6%) and led new repositories.\xa0\\nTyped contracts scale AI-assisted teams. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch LLM errors before production.\\nFrameworks ship with TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate a TypeScript codebase by default (npm create, pnpm dlx, or bunx create).\xa0\\nTyped systems help identify LLM-generated compile errors earlier in the pipeline. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures.\xa0\\nLow barrier to entry. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and IDE autoconfig hide boilerplate, so junior devs can spin up typed stacks quickly.\\nGenerative\u202fAI and agentic workflows become ordinary engineering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year we saw AI move from experiment to mainstream. In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\xa0\\nAI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million, nearly doubling in less than two years.\\nRoughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week, showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly contributors to generative-AI projects climbed sharply across our measurement year. From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan\u2013Aug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan\u2013Aug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\\nKey takeaways:\xa0\\nGenerative AI is becoming infrastructure. More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August \u201825 vs. August \u201824), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\xa0\\nGrowth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping. Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\xa0\\nAI in open source. Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using GitHub Copilot.\\nEarly evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot.

More than 693k+ were created in the last 12 months, sharply outpacing 2024\u2019s total (~400,000). The compounding curve that began in early 2023 shows no sign of tapering; every week, on average, we are still seeing new all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho\u2019s shipping the code?\\nThe U.S. remains the largest source of contributions (~12.8M, 31.8%). India ranks second (~5M, 12.5%) and leads by distinct repositories (405k vs. 342k).\\nA second tier (Germany, Japan, U.K., Korea, Canada, Brazil, Spain, France) contributes another ~40%, globalizing the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgentic tools are now being adopted in day-to-day workflows\\nThis year, GitHub Copilot coding agent went from demo to GA and we\u2019re starting to see its impact.\\nA first glimpse of coding agent shows 1+ million pull requests that were created between May 2025 and September 2025.\\nWhere it\u2019s showing up:\\nA repository-level comparison of public repositories with \u22651 coding agent-authored pull request vs. a random sample without Copilot coding agent shows strong selection effects: coding agent activity is skewed toward repositories with more stars, larger size, and greater age. In other words, teams aren\u2019t only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they\u2019re trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\xa0\\nWe invite the community to run within-repository experiments (A/B or stepped-wedge) and matched analyses conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We\u2019ll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\xa0\\nAI is driving notable breakouts in open source\\nGenerative AI projects continue to be among GitHub\u2019s most popular. Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\xa0\\n\\nRepository (age \u22643 yrs unless noted)AI connection\\n\\nvllm-project/vllmOpen source vision-language model + training/inference stack\\nggml-org/llama.cppLocal Llama inference on CPU/GPU\\ninfiniflow/ragflowEnd-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template\\ncline/cline\u201cLLM-native\u201d command-line shell that reasons over local context\\nhuggingface/transformers (6.6 yrs)Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat this tells us\\nSoftware infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity. Brand-new generative AI repositories (\u2264 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\\nStandards are emerging in real time. The rapid rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\\nAI is reshaping classic tooling. Projects like ollama and ragflow show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\\nAI is helping developers fix code, too\\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\\nBroken access control surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in 6,000+ repositories per month by mid-2025.\\nSecurity logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\\nAutofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues\u2014not just exotic vulnerabilities\u2014bringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\\nHere\u2019s how to stay ahead\\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI\u2014systems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis\u2014is emerging.\\nExpect AI libraries to become \u201cplumbing.\u201d If your stack can\u2019t load a model or pipe context into one, you\u2019ll feel legacy-bound quickly.\xa0\\nGo beyond notebooks. Package your experiments early to share them with others.\\nWatch the toolchain, not just the models. The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today\u2019s fast-rising repositories.\\nBuild for interoperability. Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\\nTake this with you\\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn\u2019t replace developers\u2014it would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\\nThe past year marked historic milestones:\xa0\\nIndia overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub. It\u2019s also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\\nTypeScript became the most used language for the first time, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\\nOpen source remains the foundation. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\\nThe story of 2025 isn\u2019t AI versus developers. It\u2019s about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\\nGlossary\\n2025: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\xa0\\nYear-over-year language comparisons: Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\\nContributions: Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\xa0\\nContributors: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\xa0\\nDeveloper: Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries\u2014from software development to data analysis and design.\\nTotal repositories: The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\\nProgramming language usage: Unless otherwise noted, \u201cmost used\u201d languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for \u201cTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.\u201d\\nAI-related repository: Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d \u201cLLM\u201d) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\\nAgentic workflows: Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\\nCopilot coding agent: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment\u2014subject to developer review and approval.\\nCopilot code review: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\\nGitHub Actions minutes: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\\nCodeQL: GitHub\u2019s semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\\nMona rank: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final \u201cMona Rank\u201d based on the summed rank.\\nLLM SDK: A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\xa0\\nMethodology\\nScope & coverage\\nOctoverse year: Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025.\\nUnless noted, metrics reflect public activity only. Public indicators are also available on the GitHub Innovation Graph. For country-level reporting there, we publish metrics only when \u2265100 unique developers performed the activity in the period.\\nTime windows\\nMonthly snapshots: Calendar-month metrics to show peaks/turning points (e.g., Aug 2025 language rankings).\\nTrailing-12-month (T12): Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925 vs Sep \u201923\u2013Aug \u201924 for year-over-year trends/averages.\\nLonger lookbacks: Historical context from Jan 2022 \u2192 Aug 2025 where relevant.\\nUnits & entities\\nContributors/developers: Monthly unique users per metric (e.g., per language). One user can appear in multiple categories in the same month, so these do not sum across categories.\\nRepositories: Counted in a month if created or active, per metric definition.\\nActivities: \u201cpushes,\u201d \u201cpull requests created/merged,\u201d \u201ccomments,\u201d etc., follow standard GitHub event definitions.\\nGrowth baselines\\nSame-month YoY: Month vs. the same month prior year (e.g., Aug \u201925 vs Aug \u201924) are used for milestones/seasonality control as in language comparisons.\\nT12 YoY: Trailing-12-month total or average vs the prior trailing-12-month metric are used for sustained trends (e.g., average monthly contributors, pull requests per month).\\nStock vs. flow (cumulative metrics): Stock = level at a point in time (e.g., SDK repos as of Aug \u201925). Flow = adds over a window (e.g., Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925). Labeled distinctly.\\nGeography\\nDevelopers are mapped to countries via self-reported locations, standardized to ISO country codes; country aggregates observe the \u2265100 developers publication threshold.\\nRepository & language classification\\nPrimary language: GitHub language detection (e.g., Linguist); mixed-language repositories are attributed to one primary language.\\nNotebooks: \u201cJupyter Notebook\u201d is a development-environment classification and is labeled transparently.\\nAI projects: Identified via signals such as generative-AI SDK usage (imports/dependencies) and related metadata.\\nOpen source quality signals: Presence of files/policies (e.g., codes of conduct) from repository metadata.\\nStatistical techniques\\nMonthly time-series tracking; cumulative counts for stock growth; Top-N rankings (contributors, repo counts, growth rates, activity volumes).\\nMinimum thresholds to reduce noise (e.g., lists may require \u22651,000 contributors or \u2265X repos; metric-specific).\\nUser de-duplication\\nCount unique users per time period and per metric to avoid within-slice double counting; cross-category duplication is expected by design.\\nData quality controls\\nExclude incomplete months (e.g., the current month) from YoY/T12.\\nFilter bots/automation where identifiable (account flags + behavioral heuristics).\\nEnforce minimum activity for inclusion in growth and rankings.\\nCross-validate against multiple internal/public sources (e.g., Innovation Graph).\\nInterpretation & reproducibility\\nSeasonality: motivates same-month YoY for snapshots and T12 for structure.\\nAttribution: primary language is repository-level; TypeScript/JavaScript mixes may appear under one language.\\nScope: public-only views undercount private activity but preserve directionality.\\nPublic counterparts for several metrics can be verified via the Innovation Graph.\\nDeveloper growth projections\\nForecasting models: a collection of time-series and regression models that use historical data and statistics to predict future outcomes. Forecasting models relied on historical GitHub data, sign-up rates and product usage, as well as market-sizing information.\xa0\\nAccuracy of forecasts: No forecast is ever accurate. Backtesting shows models used for forecasting growth projections were within reasonable levels of accuracy (less than 30% Mean Absolute Percentage Error).\\nExternal factors: Forecasts do not take into account competitive landscape changes, geopolitical/economic conditions, or future covariates (product/feature releases that may shift responses differently from historical data).\\n\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"GitHub Staff","description":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91454","categories":["News & insights","Octoverse"],"isoDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1","publishedDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","author":"GitHub Staff","summary":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Jamie Cooper","title":"Announcing the 2025 GitHub Partner Award winners \ud83c\udf89","link":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-the-2025-github-partner-award-winners/","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\\">\\n<html><body><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-moving tech industry, partnerships are a powerful engine for scale.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

Instead, it was anchored off the Port of Alexandria, Egypt \u2013 another known location for offloading grain from occupied Ukraine, according to OCCRP reporting.\\n\u201cGrain Theft\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine has repeatedly tried to dissuade countries from purchasing shipments loaded with what it describes as stolen grain from occupied regions.\xa0\\nThe Port of Sevastopol and the Avlita grain terminal remain under European, UK and US sanctions. While no UN sanctions specifically target the port, a majority of UN member states have passed resolutions condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and of its occupation of Crimea since 2024.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Irtysh and Matros Pozynich delivered grain to the Houti-controlled Port of Saleef via Djibouti \u2013 the UNVIM inspection point for Yemen. After ten years of war, the UNHCR reports that tens of thousands of people in Yemen are living in famine-like conditions, with a further five million people experiencing food insecurity.\\nUNVIM confirmed to Bellingcat that the Irtysh was inspected \u201cin line with UNVIM operational protocols\u201d on Sept. 7 and cleared by the Saudi-led coalition Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Cell (EHOC) \u2013 a body entirely separate from the UN \u2013 on Sept. 8.\\nAsked whether UNVIM was aware the vessel had picked up grain from a port under Western sanctions, the agency replied: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen. Unilateral national sanctions or measures beyond that scope are outside the UNVIM mandate.\u201d\\nNeither the Russian government nor its foreign ministry responded to requests for comment.\\n= 3 })\\n        .map(function (row) {\\n            return {\\n                row,\\n                dt: new Date(row[0].replace(/(\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}) GMT (\\\\d{2})\\\\/(\\\\d{2})\\\\/(\\\\d{4})/, \'$3/$2/$4 $1 GMT\'))\\n            }\\n        })\\n        .filter(function (obj) {\\n            return obj.dt instanceof Date && !isNaN(obj.dt.getTime());\\n        })\\n        .sort(function (a, b) {\\n            return a.dt - b.dt;\\n        });\\n\\n    sortedRows.forEach(function (obj) {\\n        const row = obj.row;\\n        const lat = parseFloat(row[1]);\\n        const lng = parseFloat(row[2]);\\n        const dt = obj.dt;\\n        if (!isNaN(lat) && !isNaN(lng)) {\\n            points.push([lng, lat]);\\n            datetimes.push(dt);\\n        }\\n    });\\n\\n    return [points, datetimes];\\n}\\n\\nfunction createShipTrackGeoJSON(points) {\\n    return {\\n        type: \\"Feature\\",\\n        geometry: {\\n            type: \\"LineString\\",\\n            coordinates: points\\n        }\\n    };\\n}\\n\\nvar [points, orientations, datetimes] = [[], [], []];\\n\\nfunction positionMap(bounds) {\\n    // Fit map to bounds and calculate suitable offset to fit screen size\\n    const mapWidth = map.getContainer().clientWidth;\\n    if (bounds) {\\n        map.fitBounds(bounds, {\\n            padding: mapWidth = 900 ? 150 : 150 * (mapWidth - 320) / (900 - 320), 0],\\n            duration: 0\\n        });\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfunction updateTrackWidth() {\\n  const main = document.querySelector(\'main.site__content\');\\n  const track = document.querySelector(\'#track\');\\n\\n  if (!main || !track) return;\\n\\n  const mainWidth = main.offsetWidth;\\n  track.style.setProperty(\'--full-width\', `${mainWidth}px`);\\n\\n  document.querySelectorAll(\'.timeline-container\').forEach(el => {\\n    el.style.setProperty(\'--full-width\', `${mainWidth}px`);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\n// Reposition map on window resize\\nwindow.addEventListener(\'resize\', function () {\\n    updateTrackWidth();\\n    // Fire on next tick to allow map to resize first\\n    setTimeout(function () {\\n        positionMap(current_bounds);\\n    }, 0);\\n})\\n\\nfunction loadShipFromAIS(ship_id = 1) {\\n    Papa.parse(`${base_url}${ship_id}/track.csv`, {\\n        download: true,\\n        header: false,\\n        complete: function (ais_data) {\\n\\n            // Create GeoJSON for ship track\\n            [points, datetimes] = loadShipTrack(ais_data);\\n            const route = createShipTrackGeoJSON(points);\\n\\n            // Add Ship Icon as Maplibre Marker\\n            const shipEl = document.createElement(\'div\');\\n            const shipMarker = new maplibregl.Marker({\\n                element: shipEl,\\n                anchor: \'center\'\\n            }).setLngLat(route.geometry.coordinates[0]);\\n\\n            fetch(`${base_url}${ship_id}/icon.svg`)\\n                .then(function (response) { return response.text();

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022.

Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak. Source: intelx.io. Below: Facebook data leak in Bellingcat\u2019s database.\\nPeople using Numbuster and GetContact, meanwhile, tagged the same phone number as belonging to Milchakov.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth screenshots depict Numbuster results for Milchakov\u2019s phone number ending in 386. Tags include his famous nickname \u201cSerb\u201d, but also \u201cAlexey Yuryevich\u201d (his name and patronymic) and \u201cSerb Milchakov Alexey\u201d.\\nContact book apps like these harvest data from users\u2019 phones and have been used in many investigations, such as Bellingcat\u2019s Berlin Tiergarten assassination investigation (where Numbuster and GetContact were used) and the investigation into the death of Colombian protestor, Lucas Villa (where TrueCaller was used).\\nIn Numbuster, one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers (ending in 663 and that he used for his Yandex Food account) is tagged as \u201cVlad United Russia St. Petersburg Youth Politics\u201d.\\n\\nThe first two entries list Romanov\u2019s name as Vladislav Gillung. The bottom entry reads, Vlad United Russia St Petersburg Youth Politics. Source: Numbuster.\\nAsked how he met Milchakov, Romanov claimed that they met at a gun shop in St. Petersburg when he was buying his hunting rifle.\\nBellingcat contacted Rusich before publication to ask about the details in this story but did not receive a response.\\nAiganysh Aidarbekova contributed to this report for Bellingcat.\\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.
