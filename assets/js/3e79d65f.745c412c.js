Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.</p></div>\\n<h2>BOTNETS R US</h2>\\n<p>Ferguson said he&#8217;s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet&#8217;s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report.

It sounds like something straight out of a horror movie: <strong>SessionReaper</strong>. Behind the cinematic name hides a very real and very dangerous remote code execution flaw, tracked as <a href=\\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54236\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\\">CVE-2025-54236</a>. It allows attackers to hijack live customer sessions\u2014and, in some setups, even take full control of the server that runs the store.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>SessionReaper lives in a part of Magento that handles communication between the store and other services.

It sounds like something straight out of a horror movie: SessionReaper. Behind the cinematic name hides a very real and very dangerous remote code execution flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-54236. It allows attackers to hijack live customer sessions\u2014and, in some setups, even take full control of the server that runs the store.\\nSessionReaper lives in a part of Magento that handles communication between the store and other services. The bug stems from improper input validation and unsafe handling of serialized data. In plain terms, Magento sometimes trusts data that no web application ever should. This lets an attacker trick the system into accepting a specially crafted \u201csession\u201d file as a legitimate user login\u2014no password required.\\nWhat they can do with that login depends on how the store is configured, but researchers at SecPod warn:\\n\u201cSuccessful exploitation of SessionReaper can lead to several severe consequences, including security feature bypass, customer account takeover, data theft, fraudulent orders, and potentially remote code execution.\u201d\\nSession-stealers like this one mean a compromised store can quietly expose a shopper\u2019s personal details, order information, or payment data to attackers.

UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, experts have previously <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/07/12/houthi-controlled-port-receives-vessel-from-occupied-crimea-after-un-inspection-body-grants-clearance/\\">highlighted to Bellingcat</a> that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat mapped Irtysh&#8217;s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd&#8217;s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: <a

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

After ten years of war, the UNHCR reports that tens of thousands of people in Yemen are living in famine-like conditions, with a further five million people experiencing food insecurity.\\nUNVIM confirmed to Bellingcat that the Irtysh was inspected \u201cin line with UNVIM operational protocols\u201d on Sept. 7 and cleared by the Saudi-led coalition Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Cell (EHOC) \u2013 a body entirely separate from the UN \u2013 on Sept. 8.\\nAsked whether UNVIM was aware the vessel had picked up grain from a port under Western sanctions, the agency replied: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-bellingcat-donate-block\\"><div><div class=\\"wp-block-image alignleft\\">\\n<figure class=\\"is-resized\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/05/question-mark.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"27\\" height=\\"27\\"/></div></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Support Bellingcat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\\">\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-button\\"><a class=\\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\\" href=\\"https://bellingcat.com/donate?utm_campaign=article_cta\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Donate</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Denis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">poisoned</a> by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"600\\" height=\\"978\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49959\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg 600w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi-184x300.jpg 184w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Vladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by <em>Monika Pakhomi (left) </em>on Nov. 8, 2019.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

Even the best AI isn&#8217;t helpful if it can&#8217;t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don&#8217;t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google&#8217;s Vertex AI, Salesforce&#8217;s <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/salesforce-agentforce-3-brings-visibility-ai-agents/\\">Agentforce</a>, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-openai-uses-third-party-data-for-chatgpt-enterprise-tasks\\">OpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it&#8217;s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"577\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg\\" alt=\\"OpenAI ChatGPT AI virtual assistant connecting to enterprise apps to surface company knowledge.\\" class=\\"wp-image-110019\\" srcset=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1536x865.jpeg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.jpeg 1920w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis. For example, a manager prepping for a client call could ask for a briefing. The model could then use recent Slack messages, email details, call notes from Google Docs, and support tickets from Intercom to make a summary.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This power can also handle confusion. If you ask, \u201cWhat are the company goals for next year?\u201d, the tool will summarise what&#8217;s been talked about and point out different opinions. This goes beyond just finding data; now it&#8217;s analysing situations and helping leaders find disagreements or unfinished decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other uses for teams:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Putting together customer feedback from Slack, survey results from Google Slides, and main topics from support tickets to plan roadmaps.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Making campaign summaries by getting data from HubSpot, briefs from Google Docs, and key points from emails.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Planning:</strong> Helping engineering leads plan releases by checking GitHub for open tasks, checking Linear for tickets, and checking Slack for bug reports.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-addressing-enterprise-ai-governance-and-implementation\\">Addressing enterprise AI governance and implementation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For CISOs and data leaders, sharing intellectual property with an AI model is a big risk. OpenAI is dealing with this by focusing on admin controls and data privacy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most important control is that the system respects your current company permissions. OpenAI has ensured that ChatGPT can only see the enterprise data that each user can already see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu admins can manage access to apps and create custom roles. OpenAI says it doesn&#8217;t train on your data by default. It also has security features like encryption, SSO, SCIM, IP whitelisting, and a Compliance API for logs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But, tech leaders should know the limits. It&#8217;s not perfect yet. Users have to pick it when starting a conversation. Also, there&#8217;s a trade-off: when company knowledge is on, ChatGPT can&#8217;t search the web or make charts. OpenAI is working to fix this soon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The tool&#8217;s usefulness depends on its ecosystem. It&#8217;s launching with key platforms and adding connectors for tools like Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, copying the strategies of IBM watsonx and SAP Joule.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI&#8217;s enterprise data knowledge surfacing is the next step for AI assistants like ChatGPT, moving them into the private core of businesses. It tries to solve the AI problem: connecting models to the data where work happens.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For business leaders, this means:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Check your data:</strong> Before using this, CISOs and CDAOs must check that data permissions in SharePoint, Google Drive, etc., are correct. The AI will only respect those permissions, so if they&#8217;re too open, the AI will show that weakness.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Pilot with tricky tasks:</strong> Instead of rolling it out to everyone, find specific workflows that are slowed down by scattered info. Preparing client briefings or making cross-department reports are good places to start measuring results.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Set expectations:</strong> Teams must know the limits. Having to manually turn it on and not being able to search the web at the same time are big limits to consider.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Watch the ecosystem:</strong> The tool&#8217;s value will depend on its integrations. CIOs should compare the tool&#8217;s connector list to their company&#8217;s tech.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Compare to current platforms:</strong> See how this compares to the AI solutions from Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce.

Even the best AI isn\u2019t helpful if it can\u2019t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.\\nThis scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don\u2019t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.\\nThis puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google\u2019s Vertex AI, Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.\\nOpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks\\nChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it\u2019s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis. For example, a manager prepping for a client call could ask for a briefing. The model could then use recent Slack messages, email details, call notes from Google Docs, and support tickets from Intercom to make a summary.\\nThis power can also handle confusion. If you ask, \u201cWhat are the company goals for next year?\u201d, the tool will summarise what\u2019s been talked about and point out different opinions. This goes beyond just finding data; now it\u2019s analysing situations and helping leaders find disagreements or unfinished decisions.\\nOther uses for teams:\\nStrategy: Putting together customer feedback from Slack, survey results from Google Slides, and main topics from support tickets to plan roadmaps.\\nReporting: Making campaign summaries by getting data from HubSpot, briefs from Google Docs, and key points from emails.\\nPlanning: Helping engineering leads plan releases by checking GitHub for open tasks, checking Linear for tickets, and checking Slack for bug reports.\\nAddressing enterprise AI governance and implementation\\nFor CISOs and data leaders, sharing intellectual property with an AI model is a big risk. OpenAI is dealing with this by focusing on admin controls and data privacy.\\nThe most important control is that the system respects your current company permissions. OpenAI has ensured that ChatGPT can only see the enterprise data that each user can already see.\\nChatGPT Enterprise and Edu admins can manage access to apps and create custom roles. OpenAI says it doesn\u2019t train on your data by default. It also has security features like encryption, SSO, SCIM, IP whitelisting, and a Compliance API for logs.\\nBut, tech leaders should know the limits. It\u2019s not perfect yet. Users have to pick it when starting a conversation. Also, there\u2019s a trade-off: when company knowledge is on, ChatGPT can\u2019t search the web or make charts. OpenAI is working to fix this soon.\\nThe tool\u2019s usefulness depends on its ecosystem. It\u2019s launching with key platforms and adding connectors for tools like Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, copying the strategies of IBM watsonx and SAP Joule.\\nOpenAI\u2019s enterprise data knowledge surfacing is the next step for AI assistants like ChatGPT, moving them into the private core of businesses. It tries to solve the AI problem: connecting models to the data where work happens.\\nFor business leaders, this means:\\nCheck your data: Before using this, CISOs and CDAOs must check that data permissions in SharePoint, Google Drive, etc., are correct. The AI will only respect those permissions, so if they\u2019re too open, the AI will show that weakness.\\nPilot with tricky tasks: Instead of rolling it out to everyone, find specific workflows that are slowed down by scattered info. Preparing client briefings or making cross-department reports are good places to start measuring results.\\nSet expectations: Teams must know the limits. Having to manually turn it on and not being able to search the web at the same time are big limits to consider.\\nWatch the ecosystem: The tool\u2019s value will depend on its integrations. CIOs should compare the tool\u2019s connector list to their company\u2019s tech.\\nCompare to current platforms: See how this compares to the AI solutions from Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce. The decision is quickly becoming about which data ecosystem offers the most secure, integrated, and cost-effective path.\\nOpenAI\u2019s new company knowledge feature shows that the most important thing for generative AI is now secure and useful data integration, not just how good the model is.\\nThis latest ChatGPT feature should make things much faster by getting rid of enterprise knowledge silos, but it also makes data governance and access control more important than ever. For business leaders, this tech isn\u2019t a simple fix. Instead, it\u2019s a good reason to get their data organised before others do.\\nSee also: OpenAI data residency advances enterprise AI governance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Druid AI unveils AI agent \u2018factory\u2019","link":"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/druid-ai-agentic-factory-automation-in-the-real-world/","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:46:57 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>\\nAt its London Symbiosis 4 event on 22 October, Druid AI introduced what it terms Virtual Authoring Teams \u2013 a new generation of AI agents that can design, test, and deploy other AI agents. The announcement marks a move towards what the company calls a &#8216;factory model&#8217; for AI automation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAccording to Druid, the system enables organisations to build enterprise-grade AI agents up to ten times faster, and the platform offers orchestration facilities, plus compliance safeguards and measurable ROI tracking. The orchestration engine, Druid Conductor, serves as a control layer that integrates data, tooling, and human oversight into a single framework.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn addition to the Druid Conductor is the Druid Agentic Marketplace, a repository of pre-built, industry-specific agents for banking, healthcare, education, and insurance. With its solutions, Druid wants to make agentic AI accessible to non-technical users, but provide scalability capability suitable for enterprise use.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChief Executive Joe Kim described it as &#8220;AI [that] actually works\u201d \u2013 a bold claim in a market flooded with experimentation and unproven automation frameworks.\\n</p>\\n<h3>The new agentic battleground</h3>\\n<p>\\nDruid is not alone in its pursuit. Similar platforms, the likes of Cognigy, Kore.ai, and Amelia, each represent heavy investment in multi-agent orchestration environments. OpenAI\u2019s GPTs and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Projects also allow users to design semi-autonomous digital workers without coding expertise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGoogle\u2019s Vertex AI Agents and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Studio are moving in the same direction, placing agentic AI as an extension to enterprise ecosystems rather than stand-alone products.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe difference between the competing platforms lies in execution \u2013 some focus on workflow automation, others on conversational depth or ease of integration with other parts of the IT stack.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor technology buyers, such diversity is an opportunity and a risk. Vendors are racing to define what agentic AI means in practice, and there&#8217;s an undoubted element of agentic AI being 2025&#8217;s buzzword, implying differentiation between pure LLM models and practical tools useful in business contexts. Some vendors view agentic as an architecture \u2013 modular, distributed, and explainable, while others frame agentic AI as a layer of automation that builds itself \u2013 or rather, can discover what powers it&#8217;s been granted, and use them according to natural language instructions. The truth of agentic AI&#8217;s abilities sits somewhere between engineering promises and operational reality.\\n</p>\\n<h3>The business case \u2013 and the caveats</h3>\\n<p>\\nAgentic AI systems promise extraordinary benefits. They can accelerate routine development, coordinate multiple business functions, and use data repositories that were once siloed. For enterprises under pressure to deliver digital transformation with limited headcount, the idea of self-building AI teams is compelling.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the use of the conditional tense in many vendors&#8217; marketing materials and descriptions is telling: agentic AI <i>can</i> achieve savings, <i>could</i> drive faster operations, and so on.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBusiness leaders should approach such systems with a clear head. There are few proven case studies beyond pilot programmes inside large corporations (those with mature data governance and deep budgets), and even in those organisations, the returns have been uneven. Failures are rarely shouted from the rooftops, after all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe biggest risks are not technical \u2013 they\u2019re organisational. Delegating complex decision-making to automated agents without sufficient oversight introduces potential bias, compliance breaches, and reputational exposure. Systems can also generate automation debt: a growing tangle of interconnected bots that become difficult to monitor or update as business processes evolve.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe issue of necessary organisational change is troubling on two counts, furthermore. Most business processes have evolved a particular way for good reasons, so why change them to implement a new, largely unproven technology? Secondly, what&#8217;s often proposed is change that&#8217;s instigated by technology implementation. Shouldn&#8217;t processes change for strategic reasons, and technology support that change? Is this a case of the IT tail wagging the business dog?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSecurity remains a further concern. Each agent increases the surface area for potential breaches or data misuse, particularly when they are designed to communicate and collaborate autonomously. As more workflows become self-directed, ensuring traceability and accountability becomes essential, and more difficult to unpick as complexity increases. The necessary headcount to monitor results and ensure rigorous oversight could negate any ROI agentic AI offers.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Why agentic AI attracts enterprises</h3>\\n<p>\\nDespite the challenges, the attraction is easy to understand. A successful agentic system can transform the speed at which an enterprise experiments and scales. By delegating repeatable cognitive tasks \u2013 from compliance checks to customer service triage \u2013 organisations can redirect human activity elsewhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDruid\u2019s Virtual Authoring Teams encapsulate the logic: automate the automation. Its marketplace of domain-specific agents offers enterprises a head start, promising faster deployments and measurable ROI. For sectors struggling with talent shortages and regulatory pressure, that is an appealing prospect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoreover, Druid\u2019s emphasis on explainable AI and its orchestration layer suggests an awareness of corporate caution. Its stated pillars \u2013 control, accuracy, and results \u2013 are designed to reassure boards that transparency can coexist with speed. If the system truly delivers what the company claims, it could narrow the gap between AI experimentation and scalable transformation.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Balancing autonomy with accountability</h3>\\n<p>\\nStill, for every organisation embracing agentic AI, another remains unconvinced. Many enterprises are wary of over-promising vendors and pilot fatigue. A technology capable of designing and deploying its own successors raises operational questions. What happens when an agent acts beyond its creator\u2019s intent? How do governance frameworks keep pace?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBusiness leaders must treat autonomy as a spectrum, not a goal. The near future of enterprise AI will likely blend human-supervised automation with limited agentic autonomy. Systems like Druid\u2019s may act as orchestration hubs rather than fully independent actors.\\n</p>\\n<h3>From hype to utility</h3>\\n<p>\\nAgentic AI represents a natural evolution of automation in a wild frontier. Its potential is obvious, yet the market still lacks broad, evidence-based validation of sustained business outcomes. It may just be early days, or may be hyperbole drowning out the voices of reason.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor now, agentic systems <i>do work</i> in controlled contexts \u2013 contact-centre operations, document processing, and IT service management. Scaling agentic AI across organisations will require maturity not just in technology, but in culture, process design, and methods of oversight.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs Druid and its peers expand their offerings, enterprises will need to weigh the cost of control against the promised wins from better automation.

Druid AI unveils AI agent &#8216;factory&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com\\">AI News</a>.</p>\\n","content:encodedSnippet":"At its London Symbiosis 4 event on 22 October, Druid AI introduced what it terms Virtual Authoring Teams \u2013 a new generation of AI agents that can design, test, and deploy other AI agents. The announcement marks a move towards what the company calls a \u2018factory model\u2019 for AI automation.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Druid, the system enables organisations to build enterprise-grade AI agents up to ten times faster, and the platform offers orchestration facilities, plus compliance safeguards and measurable ROI tracking. The orchestration engine, Druid Conductor, serves as a control layer that integrates data, tooling, and human oversight into a single framework.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the Druid Conductor is the Druid Agentic Marketplace, a repository of pre-built, industry-specific agents for banking, healthcare, education, and insurance. With its solutions, Druid wants to make agentic AI accessible to non-technical users, but provide scalability capability suitable for enterprise use.\\n\\n\\nChief Executive Joe Kim described it as \u201cAI [that] actually works\u201d \u2013 a bold claim in a market flooded with experimentation and unproven automation frameworks.\\n\\nThe new agentic battleground\\nThe business case \u2013 and the caveats\\ncan achieve savings, could drive faster operations, and so on.\\n\\n\\nBusiness leaders should approach such systems with a clear head. There are few proven case studies beyond pilot programmes inside large corporations (those with mature data governance and deep budgets), and even in those organisations, the returns have been uneven. Failures are rarely shouted from the rooftops, after all.\\n\\n\\nThe biggest risks are not technical \u2013 they\u2019re organisational. Delegating complex decision-making to automated agents without sufficient oversight introduces potential bias, compliance breaches, and reputational exposure. Systems can also generate automation debt: a growing tangle of interconnected bots that become difficult to monitor or update as business processes evolve.\\n\\n\\nThe issue of necessary organisational change is troubling on two counts, furthermore. Most business processes have evolved a particular way for good reasons, so why change them to implement a new, largely unproven technology? Secondly, what\u2019s often proposed is change that\u2019s instigated by technology implementation. Shouldn\u2019t processes change for strategic reasons, and technology support that change? Is this a case of the IT tail wagging the business dog?\\n\\n\\nSecurity remains a further concern. Each agent increases the surface area for potential breaches or data misuse, particularly when they are designed to communicate and collaborate autonomously. As more workflows become self-directed, ensuring traceability and accountability becomes essential, and more difficult to unpick as complexity increases. The necessary headcount to monitor results and ensure rigorous oversight could negate any ROI agentic AI offers.\\n\\nWhy agentic AI attracts enterprises\\nBalancing autonomy with accountability\\nFrom hype to utility\\ndo work in controlled contexts \u2013 contact-centre operations, document processing, and IT service management. Scaling agentic AI across organisations will require maturity not just in technology, but in culture, process design, and methods of oversight.\\n\\n\\nAs Druid and its peers expand their offerings, enterprises will need to weigh the cost of control against the promised wins from better automation. The next two years will determine whether AI factories become a part of business operations, or another layer of abstraction with its own overheads.\\n\\n(Image source: \u201cBlack and grey wolf (female from Druid pack,\u2019Half Black\u2019) walking in road near Lamar River bridge\u201d by YellowstoneNPS is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0. )\\n\xa0\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that&rsquo;s a strong signal.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Local testing</strong>: Test your MCP server before publishing using the<a href=\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector\\"> MCP Inspector</a>. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Agent synergy</strong>: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Tool overload fix</strong>: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won&rsquo;t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub&rsquo;s much more manageable.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"whats-next\\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started.

The goal is to make MCP server installation seamless regardless of where you write code.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Enterprise features</strong>: Governance flows to help unlock MCP usage in regulated industries. Think financial services, healthcare, and other sectors where compliance isn&rsquo;t negotiable.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Agentic workflows</strong>: GitHub MCP server will start bundling tools into use-case-driven flows (e.g., &ldquo;analyze repository + open pull request&rdquo;) instead of just exposing raw API endpoints.

Let\u2019s go!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\u2019s in the registry today\\nCurrently, the GitHub MCP Registry has 44 MCP servers, including:\\nPlaywright: Automate and test web apps.\\nGitHub MCP server: Access 100+ GitHub API tools.\\nContext7, MarkItDown (Microsoft), Terraform (HashiCorp).\\nPartner servers from Notion, Unity, Firecrawl, Stripe, and more.\\nYou can browse by tags, popularity, or GitHub stars to find the tools you need.\\nHow to install an MCP server\\nThe registry makes installation a one-click experience in VS Code or VS Code Insiders.\\nExample: Installing Playwright\\nNavigate to Playwright MCP server in the GitHub MCP Registry.\\nClick Install in VS Code.\\nVS Code launches with a pre-filled configuration.\\nAccept or adjust optional parameters (like storage paths).\\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready to use Playwright in your agentic workflows.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Remote MCP servers (like GitHub\u2019s) use OAuth during install so you don\u2019t need to manually handle tokens or secrets. Just authenticate once and start building.\\nHow to publish your own MCP server\\n1. Install the MCP Publisher CLI\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (Homebrew, recommended):\\nbrew install mcp-publisher\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (prebuilt binary, latest version):\\n\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher && sudo mv mcp-publisher /usr/local/bin/\\n2. Initialize your server.json file\\nNavigate to your server\u2019s source directory and run:\\ncd /path/to/your/mcp-server\\nmcp-publisher init\\nThis creates a server.json file. Example:\\n{\\n  \\"$schema\\": \\"https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-09-29/server.schema.json\\",\\n  \\"name\\": \\"io.github.yourname/your-server\\",\\n  \\"title\\": \\"Describe Your Server\\",\\n  \\"description\\": \\"A description of your MCP server\\",\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n  \\"packages\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"registryType\\": \\"npm\\",\\n      \\"identifier\\": \\"your-package-name\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n      \\"transport\\": { \\"type\\": \\"stdio\\" }\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n3. Prove you own the package\\nAdd the required metadata for your package type.\\nNPM: Add an \\"mcpName\\" field to your package.json:\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"your-npm-package\\",\\n  \\"mcpName\\": \\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n}\\nPyPI/NuGet: Add this to your README:\\nmcp-name: io.github.username/server-name\\nDocker: Add a label to your Dockerfile:\\nLABEL io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name=\\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n4. Authentication\\nFor GitHub-based namespaces (io.github.*), run:\\nmcp-publisher login github\\n       This will open a browser for OAuth login.\\nFor custom domains (com.yourcompany/*), follow DNS verification steps in the official docs.\\n5. Publish your server\\nOnce authenticated, publish to the registry:\\nmcp-publisher publish\\nIf successful, your server will be discoverable in the MCP registry. You can verify with:\\ncurl \\"https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=io.github.yourname/your-server\\"\\nOnce you\u2019ve completed the steps above, email\xa0partnerships@github.com\xa0and request for your server to be included.\\n\u2705 Pro tips:\xa0\\nNamespace: Use io.github.username/* for GitHub auth, or com.yourcompany/* for DNS-based verification.\\nRemote endpoints: Add a \\"remotes\\" array in your server.json for cloud/HTTP endpoints:\\n\\"remotes\\": [\\n  {\\n    \\"type\\": \\"streamable-http\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://yourdomain.com/yourserver\\"\\n  }\\n]\\nMultiple deployment options: You can list both \\"packages\\" and \\"remotes\\" for hybrid deployments.\\nExamples: See airtable-mcp-server (npm/docker/MCPB), time-mcp-nuget, time-mcp-pypi.\\nAutomate publishing with GitHub Actions\\nYou can automate publishing so every tagged release is published to both your package registry and the MCP registry.\\nCreate .github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml:\\nname: Publish to MCP Registry\\non:\\n  push:\\n    tags: [\\"v*\\"]\\n\\njobs:\\n  publish:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    permissions:\\n      id-token: write  # For OIDC\\n      contents: read\\n\\n    steps:\\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\\n\\n      # (Edit these for your package type)\\n      - name: Setup Node.js\\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v5\\n        with:\\n          node-version: \\"lts/*\\"\\n      - name: Install dependencies\\n        run: npm ci\\n      - name: Build and test\\n        run: |\\n          npm run build --if-present\\n          npm run test --if-present\\n      - name: Publish to npm\\n        run: npm publish\\n        env:\\n          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\\n\\n      # MCP publishing (works for all package types)\\n      - name: Download MCP Publisher\\n        run: |\\n          curl -L \\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher\\n      - name: Publish to MCP Registry\\n        run: |\\n          ./mcp-publisher login github-oidc\\n          ./mcp-publisher publish\\n\\n      # Optional: keep server.json version in sync with git tag\\n      - run: |\\n          VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}\\n          jq --arg v \\"$VERSION\\" \'.version = $v\' server.json > tmp && mv tmp server.json\\nTo trigger the workflow:\\ngit tag v1.0.0\\ngit push origin v1.0.0\\nWhen you publish, your server shows up in the open source registry and downstream registries (like GitHub\u2019s) automatically pick up updates. No more notifying a dozen different registries every time you ship a new version.\\n\u2705 Pro tips:\\nHost your code in a public GitHub repository to show verified ownership.\\nAdd tags in server.json so developers can easily discover your server by category.\\nUpdates propagate automatically downstream\u2014no manual notifications required\\nHow to manage MCP servers in the enterprise\\nIf you\u2019re managing MCP usage across a large organization, governance isn\u2019t optional. You need control over which servers your developers can install\u2014especially when those servers interact with sensitive data.\\nGitHub now supports registry allow lists so admins can control which MCP servers are available to developers.\\nHere are the steps for admins (which may be you!):\\nStand up or connect an internal registry that follows the MCP API spec (registry + HTTP endpoint).\\nAdd vetted MCP servers (internal + external) to your registry.\\nPoint GitHub Enterprise settings to that registry endpoint.\\nMCP-aware surfaces (starting with VS Code) enforce the allow list automatically.\\nExample: How the allow list works\\nYour internal registry at https://internal.mybank.com/mcp-registry returns:\\n{\\n  \\"servers\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/github/mcp-server\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/microsoft/markitdown-mcp\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"2.1.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"internal.mybank.com/mcp-servers/custom-tools\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.5.0\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\nWhen developers try to install an MCP server in VS Code, GitHub checks your registry endpoint and only allows installations from your approved list.\\nThis governance model means you can vet partnerships, run security scans, and maintain compliance, all while giving developers access to the tools they need.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Use GitHub\u2019s API or your existing security pipeline to vet MCP servers before adding them to your allow list.\\nTips and tricks for power users\\nOnce you\u2019ve got the basics down, here are some shortcuts to get more out of the registry:\\nSort smarter: Use GitHub stars and org verification to quickly assess quality and legitimacy. If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that\u2019s a strong signal.\\nLocal testing: Test your MCP server before publishing using the MCP Inspector. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.\xa0\\nAgent synergy: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.\\nTool overload fix: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won\u2019t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub\u2019s much more manageable.\\nWhat\u2019s next?\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s on the horizon\u2014from self-publication to enterprise adoption\u2014so you can see where the ecosystem is heading.\\nSelf-publication: Expected in the next couple months. This will unlock community-driven growth and make the registry the canonical source for all public MCP servers.\\nMore IDE support: Other IDEs are coming. The goal is to make MCP server installation seamless regardless of where you write code.\\nEnterprise features: Governance flows to help unlock MCP usage in regulated industries. Think financial services, healthcare, and other sectors where compliance isn\u2019t negotiable.\\nAgentic workflows: GitHub MCP server will start bundling tools into use-case-driven flows (e.g., \u201canalyze repository + open pull request\u201d) instead of just exposing raw API endpoints. This will make complex workflows feel like simple commands.\\nGet started today\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry has 44 servers today and will continue growing (trust us!).\\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore the MCP Registry on GitHub\\n\ud83d\udc49 To nominate your server now, email partnerships@github.com.\\nSoon, this registry will become the single source of truth for MCP servers, giving you one place to discover, install, and govern tools without hopping across outdated registries.\\nThe future of AI-assisted development isn\u2019t about coding faster. It\u2019s about orchestrating tools that amplify your impact. And the GitHub MCP Registry is where that orchestration begins.\\n\\nThe post How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"Andrea Griffiths","description":"<p>Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-find-install-and-manage-mcp-servers-with-the-github-mcp-registry/\\">How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-find-install-and-manage-mcp-servers-with-the-github-mcp-registry/\\">How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.\\nThe post How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91673","categories":["AI & ML","Generative AI","MCP"],"isoDate":"2025-10-24T16:00:00.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry","publishedDate":"2025-10-24T16:00:00.000Z","author":"Andrea Griffiths","summary":"Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.\\nThe post How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Shengyu Fu","title":"The road to better completions: Building a faster, smarter GitHub Copilot with a new custom model","link":"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/the-road-to-better-completions-building-a-faster-smarter-github-copilot-with-a-new-custom-model/","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Oct 2025 18:31:12 +0000","content:encoded":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\\">\\n<html><body><p>Code completion remains the most widely used GitHub Copilot feature, helping millions of developers stay in the flow every day. Our team has continuously iterated on the custom models powering the completions experience in GitHub Copilot driven by developer feedback. That work has had a big impact on giving you faster, more relevant suggestions in the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&rsquo;re now delivering suggestions with 20% more accepted and retained characters, 12% higher acceptance rate, 3x higher token-per-second throughput, and a 35% reduction in latency.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These updates now power GitHub Copilot across editors and environments. We&rsquo;d like to share our journey on how we trained and evaluated our custom model for code completions.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-it-matters-nbsp\\">Why it matters&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Copilot completions improve, you spend less time editing and more time building. The original Copilot was optimized for the highest acceptance rate possible. However, we realized that a heavy focus on acceptance rates could lead to incorrectly favoring a high volume of simple and short suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We heard your feedback that this didn&rsquo;t reflect real developer needs or deliver the highest quality experience. So, we pivoted to also optimize for accepted and retained characters, code flow, and other metrics.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>20% higher accepted-and-retained characters</strong> results in more of each Copilot suggestion staying in your final code, not just ending up temporarily accepted and deleted later. In other words, suggestions provide more value with fewer keystrokes.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>12% higher acceptance rate</strong> means you find suggestions more useful more often, reflecting better immediate utility.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>3x throughput</strong> <strong>with 35% lower latency</strong> makes Copilot feel faster. It handles more requests at once while keeping your coding flow unbroken (throughput describes how much work the system can handle overall, while latency describes how quickly each individual request completes).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-we-evaluate-custom-models-nbsp\\">How we evaluate custom models&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot models are evaluated using combined signals from <strong>offline</strong>, <strong>pre-production</strong>, and <strong>production</strong> evaluations.

To ensure the best possible outcomes, we run an independent LLM to score completions across three axes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Quality:</strong> Ensure syntax validity, duplication/overlap, format and style consistency.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Relevance: </strong>Focus on relevant code, avoid hallucination and overreach.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Helpfulness:</strong> Reduce manual effort, avoid outdated or deprecated APIs.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-2-pre-production-evaluations-qualitative-dogfooding-nbsp\\">2) Pre-production evaluations: Qualitative dogfooding&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our next step includes working with internal developers and partners to test models side-by-side in real workflows (to do the latter, we exposed the preview model to developers through Copilot&rsquo;s model picker). We collect structured feedback on readability, trust, and &ldquo;taste.&rdquo; Part of this process includes working with language experts to improve overall completion quality. This is unique: while execution-based testing, LLM-based evaluations, dogfood testing, and A/B testing are common, we find language-specific evaluations lead to better outcomes along quality and style preferences.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-3-production-based-evaluations-a-b-testing-nbsp\\">3) Production-based evaluations: A/B testing&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ultimately, the lived experience of developers like you is what matters most. We measure improvements using accepted-and-retained characters, acceptance rates, completion-shown rate, time-to-first token, latency, and many other metrics. We ship only when statistically significant improvements hold up under real developer workloads.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-we-trained-our-new-copilot-completions-model-nbsp\\">How we trained our new Copilot completions model&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-mid-training-nbsp\\">Mid-training&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Modern codebases use modern APIs. Before fine-tuning, we build a code-specific foundational model via mid-training using a curated, de-duplicated corpus of modern, idiomatic, public, and internal code with nearly 10M repositories and 600-plus programming languages. (Mid-training refers to the stage after the base model has been pretrained on a very large, diverse corpus, but before it undergoes final fine-tuning or instruction-tuning).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is a critical step to ensure behaviors, new language syntax, and recent API versions are utilized by the model. We then use supervised fine-<s> </s>tuning and reinforcement learning while mixing objectives beyond next-token prediction&mdash;span infillings and docstring/function pairs&mdash;so the model learns structure, naming, and intent, not just next-token prediction. This helps us make the foundational model code-fluent, style-consistent, and context-aware, ready for more targeted fine-tuning via supervised fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-supervised-fine-tuning-nbsp\\">Supervised fine-tuning&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Newer general-purpose chat models perform well in natural language to generate code, but underperform on fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code completion. In practice, chat models experience cursor-misaligned inserts, duplication of code before the cursor (prefix), and overwrites of code after the cursor (suffix).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we moved to fine-tuned behaviors, we trained models specialized in completions by way of synthetic fine-tuning to behave like a great FIM engine. In practice, this improves:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Prefix/suffix awareness</strong>: Accurate inserts between tokens, mid-line continuations, full line completions, and multi-line block completions without trampling the suffix.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Formatting fidelity</strong>: Respect local style (indentation, imports, docstrings) and avoid prefix duplication.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The result is significantly improved FIM performance.

Our team has continuously iterated on the custom models powering the completions experience in GitHub Copilot driven by developer feedback. That work has had a big impact on giving you faster, more relevant suggestions in the editor.\xa0\xa0\\nWe\u2019re now delivering suggestions with 20% more accepted and retained characters, 12% higher acceptance rate, 3x higher token-per-second throughput, and a 35% reduction in latency.\xa0\\nThese updates now power GitHub Copilot across editors and environments. We\u2019d like to share our journey on how we trained and evaluated our custom model for code completions.\xa0\\nWhy it matters\xa0\\nWhen Copilot completions improve, you spend less time editing and more time building. The original Copilot was optimized for the highest acceptance rate possible. However, we realized that a heavy focus on acceptance rates could lead to incorrectly favoring a high volume of simple and short suggestions.\xa0\xa0\\nWe heard your feedback that this didn\u2019t reflect real developer needs or deliver the highest quality experience. So, we pivoted to also optimize for accepted and retained characters, code flow, and other metrics.\xa0\\n20% higher accepted-and-retained characters results in more of each Copilot suggestion staying in your final code, not just ending up temporarily accepted and deleted later. In other words, suggestions provide more value with fewer keystrokes.\\n12% higher acceptance rate means you find suggestions more useful more often, reflecting better immediate utility.\xa0\\n3x throughput with 35% lower latency makes Copilot feel faster. It handles more requests at once while keeping your coding flow unbroken (throughput describes how much work the system can handle overall, while latency describes how quickly each individual request completes).\\nHow we evaluate custom models\xa0\\nCopilot models are evaluated using combined signals from offline, pre-production, and production evaluations. Each layer helps us refine different aspects of the experience while ensuring better quality in real developer workflows.\xa0\\n1) Offline evaluations\xa0\xa0\\nExecution-based benchmark: As part of our offline evaluations, we first test against internal and public repositories with strong code by unit test and scenario coverage, spanning all major languages. Each test simulates real tasks, accepts suggestions, and measures build-and-test pass rates. This emphasizes functional correctness over surface fluency.\xa0\xa0\\nBelow is an example of a partial token completion error: the model produced dataet instead of dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM-judge scoring: While we start with execution-based evaluation, this has downsides: it only tells if the code will compile, but the results are not always aligned with developer preferences. To ensure the best possible outcomes, we run an independent LLM to score completions across three axes:\xa0\xa0\\nQuality: Ensure syntax validity, duplication/overlap, format and style consistency.\xa0\\nRelevance: Focus on relevant code, avoid hallucination and overreach.\xa0\\nHelpfulness: Reduce manual effort, avoid outdated or deprecated APIs.\xa0\\n2) Pre-production evaluations: Qualitative dogfooding\xa0\\nOur next step includes working with internal developers and partners to test models side-by-side in real workflows (to do the latter, we exposed the preview model to developers through Copilot\u2019s model picker). We collect structured feedback on readability, trust, and \u201ctaste.\u201d Part of this process includes working with language experts to improve overall completion quality. This is unique: while execution-based testing, LLM-based evaluations, dogfood testing, and A/B testing are common, we find language-specific evaluations lead to better outcomes along quality and style preferences.\xa0\\n3) Production-based evaluations: A/B testing\xa0\\nUltimately, the lived experience of developers like you is what matters most. We measure improvements using accepted-and-retained characters, acceptance rates, completion-shown rate, time-to-first token, latency, and many other metrics. We ship only when statistically significant improvements hold up under real developer workloads.\xa0\\nHow we trained our new Copilot completions model\xa0\\nMid-training\xa0\\nModern codebases use modern APIs. Before fine-tuning, we build a code-specific foundational model via mid-training using a curated, de-duplicated corpus of modern, idiomatic, public, and internal code with nearly 10M repositories and 600-plus programming languages. (Mid-training refers to the stage after the base model has been pretrained on a very large, diverse corpus, but before it undergoes final fine-tuning or instruction-tuning).\xa0\\nThis is a critical step to ensure behaviors, new language syntax, and recent API versions are utilized by the model. We then use supervised fine- tuning and reinforcement learning while mixing objectives beyond next-token prediction\u2014span infillings and docstring/function pairs\u2014so the model learns structure, naming, and intent, not just next-token prediction. This helps us make the foundational model code-fluent, style-consistent, and context-aware, ready for more targeted fine-tuning via supervised fine-tuning.\xa0\\nSupervised fine-tuning\xa0\\nNewer general-purpose chat models perform well in natural language to generate code, but underperform on fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code completion. In practice, chat models experience cursor-misaligned inserts, duplication of code before the cursor (prefix), and overwrites of code after the cursor (suffix).\xa0\xa0\\nAs we moved to fine-tuned behaviors, we trained models specialized in completions by way of synthetic fine-tuning to behave like a great FIM engine. In practice, this improves:\xa0\\nPrefix/suffix awareness: Accurate inserts between tokens, mid-line continuations, full line completions, and multi-line block completions without trampling the suffix.\xa0\\nFormatting fidelity: Respect local style (indentation, imports, docstrings) and avoid prefix duplication.\xa0\\nThe result is significantly improved FIM performance. For example, here is a benchmark comparing our latest completions model to GPT-4.1-mini on OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Infilling Benchmarks.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning\xa0\\nFinally, we used a custom reinforcement learning algorithm, teaching the model through rewards and penalties to internalize what makes code suggestions useful in real developer scenarios along three axes:\\nQuality: Syntax-valid, compilable code that follows project style (indentations, imports, headers).\xa0\xa0\\nRelevance: On-task suggestions that respect surrounding context and the file\u2019s intent.\xa0\xa0\\nHelpfulness: Suggestions that reduce manual effort and prefer modern APIs.\xa0\xa0\\nTogether, these create completions that are correct, relevant, and genuinely useful at the cursor instead of being verbose or superficially helpful.\xa0\\nWhat we learned\xa0\\nAfter talking with programming language experts and finding success in our prompt-based approach, one of our most important lessons was adding related files like C++ header files to our training data. Beyond this, we also came away with three key learnings:\xa0\\nReward carefully: Early reinforcement learning version over-optimized for longer completions, adding too many comments in the form of \u201creward hacking.\u201d To mitigate this problem, we introduced comment guardrails to keep completions concise and focused on moving the task forward while penalizing unnecessary commentary.\xa0\\nMetrics matter: Being hyper-focused on a metric like acceptance rate can lead to experiences that look good on paper, but do not result in happy developers. That makes it critical to evaluate performance by monitoring multiple metrics with real-world impact.\\nTrain for real-world usage: We align our synthetic fine-tuning data with real-world usage and adapt our training accordingly. This helps us identify problematic patterns and remove them via training to improve real-world outcomes.\xa0\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next\xa0\\nWe\u2019re continuing to push the frontier of Copilot completions by:\xa0\\nExpanding into domain-specific slices (e.g., game engines, financial, ERP).\xa0\\nRefining reward functions for build/test success, semantic usefulness (edits that advance the user\u2019s intent without bloat), and API modernity preference for up-to-date, idiomatic libraries and patterns. This is helping us shape completion behavior with greater precision.\xa0\\nDriving faster, cheaper, higher-quality completions across all developer environments.\xa0\xa0\\nExperience faster, smarter code completions yourself.

You know how it goes: you start by asking \u201cwhat if?\u201d and then you have something weird and wonderful hours later.\xa0\\nThis summer, we decided to celebrate that spirit with For the Love of Code, our first-ever competition for projects built purely for fun. More than 300 developers answered the call. Some leaned on GitHub Copilot to refactor ideas, fix bugs, and spark inspiration. Some teamed up. Others flew solo, guided only by caffeine and curiosity.\\nEntries spanned everything from a Breakout game powered by your GitHub graph, to a laugh-track that plays on every commit, a Yelp-style code reviewer in VS Code \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606, a Copilot you can literally see on camera, and even a comic strip made from your release notes.\\nWe invited participants to build anything that sparks joy across six whimsical categories:\\n\ud83d\udd18 Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights: Hardware hacks, LEDs, sensors, and gadgets galore.\\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Terminal talent: Command-line creations and retro computing love letters.\\n\ud83c\udf10 World wide wonders: Browser-based experiments, apps, and interactive art.\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents of change: AI, bots, and automation with heart.\\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Game on: Games big or small, serious or silly.\\n\ud83c\udccf Everything but the kitchen sink: The wildcard (if it doesn\u2019t fit anywhere else, it fits here).\\n\ud83d\udca1 How GitHub Copilot powered creativity\\nGitHub Copilot helped contest participants:\\nCreate efficient Go code to integrate with the GitHub API\\nScaffold repetitive code and boilerplate\\nSuggest API calls and syntax corrections\\nDebug hardware quirks and runtime errors\\nSpark inspiration for algorithms and UI design\\nWrite their first Python program\\nMake their first real push to GitHub\\nAnd it didn\u2019t stop there. When creativity met Copilot, side projects turned into something spectacular.\\nDiscover how Copilot can help you with your project >\\nMeet the winners: Open source experiments, AI side projects, and more\\nHere are the top three entries from each category.\\n\ud83d\udd18 Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights\xa0\\nPlane Tracker: DIY radar on your desk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlane Tracker by @cpstroum is a DIY radar that uses an Adafruit Circuit Playground, Bluetooth, and the ADS-B Exchange API to fetch live flight data. It turns nearby planes into a real-time mini radar display.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @cpstroum with Git itself and with structuring the initial project for their first real push to GitHub. Thanks, Copilot! And welcome aboard, @cpstroum!\\n\\n\\n\\nCadrephoto: The easy e-ink photo frame\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCadrephoto by @ozh is a Raspberry Pi and e-ink photo frame that displays pictures emailed to it (no app, no setup, perfect for less tech-savvy people). It checks an inbox, downloads the latest photo, and updates the screen automatically.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @ozh with their first Python project. It worked smoothly inside JetBrains IDEs and made code completion feel almost like magic.\\n\\n\\n\\nBuildIn: Traffic-light builds for your repository\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuildIn by @SUNSET-Sejong-University and @lepetitprince99 is a real-life traffic light for your code that sits on your desk. Using an Arduino and the GitHub API, it lights up red, yellow, green, or blue to show your repository\u2019s build status at a glance.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @SUNSET-Sejong-University debug and optimize their code. It saved time tracking down tricky hardware issues and made troubleshooting much easier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Terminal talent\\nRestoHack: A roguelike resurrected from 1984\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRestoHack by @Critlist resurrects the 1984 roguelike game that inspired NetHack, rebuilt from the original source with modern tools and a preservationist\u2019s touch. It compiles cleanly, runs faithfully, and proves that forty years later, permadeath still hits hard.\\nJukebox CLI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJukebox CLI by @FedeCarollo is a colorful, animated jukebox that runs right in your terminal. Built in Rust with Ratatui, it plays MP3s, shows floating musical notes, and color-codes each track in a scrollable playlist. You can play, pause, skip, and adjust the volume without ever leaving your command line.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @FedeCarollo explore unfamiliar Rust libraries and find their footing.\\n\\n\\n\\nTuneminal: Sing your commits from the command line\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuneminal by @heza-ru turns your terminal into a full-blown karaoke stage with scrolling lyrics, live audio visualization, and scoring that rewards your inner rock star. It\u2019s open source, cross-platform, and the perfect excuse to sing while that git clone takes a while.\\n\ud83c\udf10 World wide wonders\\nNetstalgia: Surf the \u201890s web on virtual dial-up\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetstalgia by @heza-ru (again!) is a fully functional \u201890s web fever dream built with modern tech, but visually stuck on virtual dial-up. It\u2019s got dancing babies, popup ads, a fake BBS, and more CRT glow than your old Gateway 2000 ever survived.\\nIn true retro internet spirit, it even ships with a fake GitHub Star Ransomware\u2014a tongue-in-cheek \u201cvirus\u201d that demands you star the repo to \u201cdecrypt your files.\u201d A clever (and harmless) new twist on the eternal quest for GitHub stars. \u2b50\ud83d\udcbe\\nBionic Reader: Speed read your screen\\nBionic Reader by @Awesome-XV rewires how you read by bolding the first few letters of each word so your brain fills in the rest. It\u2019s like giving your eyes a speed boost without the caffeine jitters to read faster than ever.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @Awesome-XV write project documentation and scaffold the initial codebase.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Git Roast Show: Roast your GitHub profile\u2026 lovingly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGit Roast Show by @rawrnuck and @Anmol0201 is a full-stack web app that humorously \u201croasts\u201d your GitHub profile. Built with React, Vite, and Express, it fetches live GitHub data to generate personalized, sound-enhanced, and animated comedy roasts.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @rawrnuck understand algorithms and handle the repetitive parts of their project.\\n\\n\\n\\nNightlio: a mood tracker you actually own\\nNightlio by @shirsakm is a privacy-first mood tracker and daily journal you can self-host in minutes. Log how you feel on a 5-point scale, add Markdown notes, tag entries like #Sleep or #Productivity, then explore calendars, streaks, and simple stats to spot patterns. It runs anywhere with Docker, stores data in a local SQLite file, and keeps things clean with JWT-protected APIs, a React/Vite front end, and optional Google OAuth. No ads. No subscriptions. Your server, your rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Because @heza-ru placed in two categories, we\u2019ve added a fourth winner to this category.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @shirsakm with refactors, color palette updates, and codebase-wide changes that would have taken much longer by hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents of change\\nNeosgenesis: AI that thinks about thinking\\nNeosgenesis by @answeryt is a metacognitive AI framework that teaches machines to think about how they think. It runs a five-stage loop (think, verify, learn, optimize, decide) while juggling multiple LLMs, tools, and real-time feedback. A multi-armed bandit picks the best reasoning patterns, and when it stalls, an \u201caha\u201d mode explores fresh paths.\\nMediVision Assistant: Accessible AI healthcare for all\\nMediVision Assistant by @omkardongre is an AI healthcare companion that helps elderly and disabled users manage their health through voice, image, and video. Users can scan medications, analyze skin conditions, log symptoms by voice, and chat with an AI doctor-like assistant.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @omkardongre generate React components, API templates, and AI integration code. It handled the boilerplate so they could focus on building features and improving the experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuiviva: The r\xe9sum\xe9 that talks back\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuiviva by @katawiecz is an interactive AI-powered CV that turns a job hunt into a chat adventure. Ask about skills or projects, or type \u201cGandalf\u201d to unlock secret nerd mode. All this goes to show that even r\xe9sum\xe9s can be fun.\\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Game on\\nAI-Dventure: Infinite worlds, infinite choices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI-Dventure by @FedeCarollo is an interactive text adventure built in Rust and powered by OpenAI\u2019s models. Players explore dynamically generated worlds in fantasy, horror, sci-fi, or historical settings where every command shapes the story and no two runs are the same.\\nBeatBugging: Debug to the beat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeatBugging by @sandra-aliaga, @Joshep-c, @RyanValdivia, and @tniia turns debugging into a rhythm game that converts your system logs into musical beats. Built in Python, it lets you fix bugs to the rhythm on a 5-by-5 grid and makes debugging sound unexpectedly good.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped the team figure out next steps when they got stuck, offering helpful hints that kept development moving.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuMind: A multiplayer battle of wits and vibes\\nMuMind by @FontesHabana is a web-based multiplayer version of the party game Herd Mentality, where players try to match the majority\u2019s answers to score points. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, it offers multilingual support, lively animations, and a smooth, responsive experience.\\n\ud83c\udccf Everything but the kitchen sink\\nGitFrag: Defrag your contributions graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@chornonoh-vova built GitFrag to reorganize your contributions graph using classic sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick, and counting sort).

There\u2019s also a wonderful writeup of how the developer approached it.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @chornonoh-vova structure their understanding of algorithms and add thoughtful details that made their visualization shine.\\n\\n\\n\\nCode Sensei: Meditate your way through VS Code\\nCode Sensei by @redhatsam09 turns your VS Code sessions into a zen pixel adventure where your focus fuels the fun. Type to walk, pause to hop\u2014but stay away too long away and your sensei meets a dramatic, 8-bit demise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReviewer Karma: Good vibes for great reviews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReviewer Karma by @master-wayne7 keeps your pull requests peaceful by rewarding reviewers for good vibes and great feedback. Every emoji, comment, and code critique earns points on a live leaderboard that turns pull request reviews into a friendly competition.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @master-wayne7 write efficient Go code for the GitHub API, structure logic for assigning karma points, and handle repetitive tasks like error checking and markdown generation. It kept the project flowing smoothly from start to finish.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese projects show what\u2019s possible when we let our curiosity take center stage\\nRemember these are hackathon projects. They might not be feature complete, there may be bugs, spaghetti code, and the occasional rogue program escaped from the Grid. But they are clear examples of what we can accomplish when we do something just for the love of it.\\nAll of our category winners get 12 months of GitHub Copilot Pro+.\\nIf For the Love of Code proved anything, it\u2019s that creativity and code thrive best together\u2014especially with Copilot lending a hand.\\nShoutout to the makers\\nCongratulations to all of our winners: @Anmol0201, @answeryt, @Awesome-XV, @chornonoh-vova, @cpstroum, @Critlist, @FedeCarollo, @FontesHabana, @heza-ru, @joshep-c, @katawiecz, @lepetitprince99, @master-wayne7, @omkardongre, @RyanValdivia, @ozh, @rawrnuck, @redhatsam09, @sandra-aliaga, @shirsakm, @SUNSET-Sejong-University, @tniia.\\nMassive thank you to our judges, which included a mix of GitHub Stars, Campus Experts, and GitHub Developer Relations friends: @Ba4bes, @colbyfayock, @j0ashm, @JuanGdev, @howard-lio, @luckyjoseph, @metzinaround, @Taiwrash, and @xavidop.\\nAnd thank you Copilot for your assistance!\\nNow back to work everyone!

The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.\\nControl of the build system and access to the source code, customer configurations, and documentation of unpatched vulnerabilities has the potential to give the hackers unprecedented knowledge of weaknesses and the ability to exploit them in supply-chain attacks on thousands of networks, many of which are sensitive. The theft of customer configurations and other data further raises the risk that sensitive credentials can be abused, F5 and outside security experts said.\\n\\nF5 announcement.","id":"https://www.schneier.com/?p=71041","isoDate":"2025-10-23T11:04:48.000Z","feedKey":"schneier-security","feedTitle":"Schneier on Security","category":"cyber","cleanTitle":"Serious F5 Breach","publishedDate":"2025-10-23T11:04:48.000Z"},{"title":" Meta boosts scam protection on WhatsApp and Messenger ","link":"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2025/10/meta-boosts-scam-protection-on-whatsapp-and-messenger","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:39:37 GMT","content:encoded":"\\n<p>Vulnerable Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users are getting more protection thanks to a move from the applications&#8217; owner, Meta.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

Instead, it was anchored off the Port of Alexandria, Egypt \u2013 another known location for offloading grain from occupied Ukraine, according to OCCRP reporting.\\n\u201cGrain Theft\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine has repeatedly tried to dissuade countries from purchasing shipments loaded with what it describes as stolen grain from occupied regions.\xa0\\nThe Port of Sevastopol and the Avlita grain terminal remain under European, UK and US sanctions.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-bellingcat-donate-block\\"><div><div class=\\"wp-block-image alignleft\\">\\n<figure class=\\"is-resized\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/05/question-mark.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"27\\" height=\\"27\\"/></div></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Support Bellingcat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\\">\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-button\\"><a class=\\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\\" href=\\"https://bellingcat.com/donate?utm_campaign=article_cta\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Donate</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Denis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">poisoned</a> by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak. Source: intelx.io. Below: Facebook data leak in Bellingcat\u2019s database.\\nPeople using Numbuster and GetContact, meanwhile, tagged the same phone number as belonging to Milchakov.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth screenshots depict Numbuster results for Milchakov\u2019s phone number ending in 386. Tags include his famous nickname \u201cSerb\u201d, but also \u201cAlexey Yuryevich\u201d (his name and patronymic) and \u201cSerb Milchakov Alexey\u201d.\\nContact book apps like these harvest data from users\u2019 phones and have been used in many investigations, such as Bellingcat\u2019s Berlin Tiergarten assassination investigation (where Numbuster and GetContact were used) and the investigation into the death of Colombian protestor, Lucas Villa (where TrueCaller was used).\\nIn Numbuster, one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers (ending in 663 and that he used for his Yandex Food account) is tagged as \u201cVlad United Russia St. Petersburg Youth Politics\u201d.\\n\\nThe first two entries list Romanov\u2019s name as Vladislav Gillung.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage. NASA FIRMS continued to detect active fires in Etosha up until Oct. 5. \\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann. Top left: The Overlander Airport, where he allegedly met an aircraft on Dec 27, 2024. Bottom left: cocaine seized by the AFP. Right: Herrmann after he was detained. Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region. Source: Flightradar24, Facebook, Google Earth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sunday Times reports today that the Sling 4 kit-plane piloted by Clark had been heavily modified for transatlantic flights. A source told the newspaper that Clark replaced the engine at least once in Brazil, indicating he was continuously flying it long-haul, and may have fitted a third engine due to the number of flying hours he was accumulating.\xa0\\nClark\u2019s plane crashed about an 11-hour flight from the Amazon basin, a region that has become a major trafficking route for cocaine bound for Europe, the drug\u2019s fastest-expanding market.\xa0\\n\\nThe wreckage of Clark\u2019s plane, which crashed earlier this month in Coruripe on the southern coast of the Brazilian state of Alagoas.

His case is listed for a committal mention in Perth Magistrates Court on October 10.\\nPeter Barth, Connor Plunkett, Beau Donelly and John Mooney contributed to this article.\\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

href=\\"https://openai.com/\\">OpenAI</a> is surfacing company knowledge by connecting ChatGPT to enterprise data, turning it from a general assistant into a custom analyst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For business leaders, generative AI&#8217;s potential has always been limited by its lack of access to internal data. Even the best AI isn&#8217;t helpful if it can&#8217;t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don&#8217;t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google&#8217;s Vertex AI, Salesforce&#8217;s <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/salesforce-agentforce-3-brings-visibility-ai-agents/\\">Agentforce</a>, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-openai-uses-third-party-data-for-chatgpt-enterprise-tasks\\">OpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it&#8217;s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"577\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg\\" alt=\\"OpenAI ChatGPT AI virtual assistant connecting to enterprise apps to surface company knowledge.\\" class=\\"wp-image-110019\\" srcset=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1536x865.jpeg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.jpeg 1920w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis. For example, a manager prepping for a client call could ask for a briefing. The model could then use recent Slack messages, email details, call notes from Google Docs, and support tickets from Intercom to make a summary.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This power can also handle confusion. If you ask, \u201cWhat are the company goals for next year?\u201d, the tool will summarise what&#8217;s been talked about and point out different opinions. This goes beyond just finding data; now it&#8217;s analysing situations and helping leaders find disagreements or unfinished decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other uses for teams:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Putting together customer feedback from Slack, survey results from Google Slides, and main topics from support tickets to plan roadmaps.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Making campaign summaries by getting data from HubSpot, briefs from Google Docs, and key points from emails.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Planning:</strong> Helping engineering leads plan releases by checking GitHub for open tasks, checking Linear for tickets, and checking Slack for bug reports.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-addressing-enterprise-ai-governance-and-implementation\\">Addressing enterprise AI governance and implementation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For CISOs and data leaders, sharing intellectual property with an AI model is a big risk. OpenAI is dealing with this by focusing on admin controls and data privacy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most important control is that the system respects your current company permissions. OpenAI has ensured that ChatGPT can only see the enterprise data that each user can already see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu admins can manage access to apps and create custom roles. OpenAI says it doesn&#8217;t train on your data by default. It also has security features like encryption, SSO, SCIM, IP whitelisting, and a Compliance API for logs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But, tech leaders should know the limits. It&#8217;s not perfect yet. Users have to pick it when starting a conversation. Also, there&#8217;s a trade-off: when company knowledge is on, ChatGPT can&#8217;t search the web or make charts. OpenAI is working to fix this soon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The tool&#8217;s usefulness depends on its ecosystem. It&#8217;s launching with key platforms and adding connectors for tools like Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, copying the strategies of IBM watsonx and SAP Joule.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI&#8217;s enterprise data knowledge surfacing is the next step for AI assistants like ChatGPT, moving them into the private core of businesses.

Even the best AI isn\u2019t helpful if it can\u2019t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.\\nThis scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don\u2019t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.\\nThis puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google\u2019s Vertex AI, Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.\\nOpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks\\nChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it\u2019s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis. For example, a manager prepping for a client call could ask for a briefing. The model could then use recent Slack messages, email details, call notes from Google Docs, and support tickets from Intercom to make a summary.\\nThis power can also handle confusion. If you ask, \u201cWhat are the company goals for next year?\u201d, the tool will summarise what\u2019s been talked about and point out different opinions. This goes beyond just finding data; now it\u2019s analysing situations and helping leaders find disagreements or unfinished decisions.\\nOther uses for teams:\\nStrategy: Putting together customer feedback from Slack, survey results from Google Slides, and main topics from support tickets to plan roadmaps.\\nReporting: Making campaign summaries by getting data from HubSpot, briefs from Google Docs, and key points from emails.\\nPlanning: Helping engineering leads plan releases by checking GitHub for open tasks, checking Linear for tickets, and checking Slack for bug reports.\\nAddressing enterprise AI governance and implementation\\nFor CISOs and data leaders, sharing intellectual property with an AI model is a big risk. OpenAI is dealing with this by focusing on admin controls and data privacy.\\nThe most important control is that the system respects your current company permissions. OpenAI has ensured that ChatGPT can only see the enterprise data that each user can already see.\\nChatGPT Enterprise and Edu admins can manage access to apps and create custom roles. OpenAI says it doesn\u2019t train on your data by default. It also has security features like encryption, SSO, SCIM, IP whitelisting, and a Compliance API for logs.\\nBut, tech leaders should know the limits. It\u2019s not perfect yet. Users have to pick it when starting a conversation. Also, there\u2019s a trade-off: when company knowledge is on, ChatGPT can\u2019t search the web or make charts. OpenAI is working to fix this soon.\\nThe tool\u2019s usefulness depends on its ecosystem. It\u2019s launching with key platforms and adding connectors for tools like Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, copying the strategies of IBM watsonx and SAP Joule.\\nOpenAI\u2019s enterprise data knowledge surfacing is the next step for AI assistants like ChatGPT, moving them into the private core of businesses. It tries to solve the AI problem: connecting models to the data where work happens.\\nFor business leaders, this means:\\nCheck your data: Before using this, CISOs and CDAOs must check that data permissions in SharePoint, Google Drive, etc., are correct. The AI will only respect those permissions, so if they\u2019re too open, the AI will show that weakness.\\nPilot with tricky tasks: Instead of rolling it out to everyone, find specific workflows that are slowed down by scattered info. Preparing client briefings or making cross-department reports are good places to start measuring results.\\nSet expectations: Teams must know the limits. Having to manually turn it on and not being able to search the web at the same time are big limits to consider.\\nWatch the ecosystem: The tool\u2019s value will depend on its integrations. CIOs should compare the tool\u2019s connector list to their company\u2019s tech.\\nCompare to current platforms: See how this compares to the AI solutions from Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce. The decision is quickly becoming about which data ecosystem offers the most secure, integrated, and cost-effective path.\\nOpenAI\u2019s new company knowledge feature shows that the most important thing for generative AI is now secure and useful data integration, not just how good the model is.\\nThis latest ChatGPT feature should make things much faster by getting rid of enterprise knowledge silos, but it also makes data governance and access control more important than ever.

Druid AI unveils AI agent \u2018factory\u2019","link":"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/druid-ai-agentic-factory-automation-in-the-real-world/","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:46:57 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>\\nAt its London Symbiosis 4 event on 22 October, Druid AI introduced what it terms Virtual Authoring Teams \u2013 a new generation of AI agents that can design, test, and deploy other AI agents. The announcement marks a move towards what the company calls a &#8216;factory model&#8217; for AI automation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAccording to Druid, the system enables organisations to build enterprise-grade AI agents up to ten times faster, and the platform offers orchestration facilities, plus compliance safeguards and measurable ROI tracking. The orchestration engine, Druid Conductor, serves as a control layer that integrates data, tooling, and human oversight into a single framework.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn addition to the Druid Conductor is the Druid Agentic Marketplace, a repository of pre-built, industry-specific agents for banking, healthcare, education, and insurance. With its solutions, Druid wants to make agentic AI accessible to non-technical users, but provide scalability capability suitable for enterprise use.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChief Executive Joe Kim described it as &#8220;AI [that] actually works\u201d \u2013 a bold claim in a market flooded with experimentation and unproven automation frameworks.\\n</p>\\n<h3>The new agentic battleground</h3>\\n<p>\\nDruid is not alone in its pursuit. Similar platforms, the likes of Cognigy, Kore.ai, and Amelia, each represent heavy investment in multi-agent orchestration environments. OpenAI\u2019s GPTs and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Projects also allow users to design semi-autonomous digital workers without coding expertise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGoogle\u2019s Vertex AI Agents and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Studio are moving in the same direction, placing agentic AI as an extension to enterprise ecosystems rather than stand-alone products.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe difference between the competing platforms lies in execution \u2013 some focus on workflow automation, others on conversational depth or ease of integration with other parts of the IT stack.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor technology buyers, such diversity is an opportunity and a risk. Vendors are racing to define what agentic AI means in practice, and there&#8217;s an undoubted element of agentic AI being 2025&#8217;s buzzword, implying differentiation between pure LLM models and practical tools useful in business contexts. Some vendors view agentic as an architecture \u2013 modular, distributed, and explainable, while others frame agentic AI as a layer of automation that builds itself \u2013 or rather, can discover what powers it&#8217;s been granted, and use them according to natural language instructions. The truth of agentic AI&#8217;s abilities sits somewhere between engineering promises and operational reality.\\n</p>\\n<h3>The business case \u2013 and the caveats</h3>\\n<p>\\nAgentic AI systems promise extraordinary benefits. They can accelerate routine development, coordinate multiple business functions, and use data repositories that were once siloed. For enterprises under pressure to deliver digital transformation with limited headcount, the idea of self-building AI teams is compelling.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the use of the conditional tense in many vendors&#8217; marketing materials and descriptions is telling: agentic AI <i>can</i> achieve savings, <i>could</i> drive faster operations, and so on.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBusiness leaders should approach such systems with a clear head. There are few proven case studies beyond pilot programmes inside large corporations (those with mature data governance and deep budgets), and even in those organisations, the returns have been uneven. Failures are rarely shouted from the rooftops, after all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe biggest risks are not technical \u2013 they\u2019re organisational. Delegating complex decision-making to automated agents without sufficient oversight introduces potential bias, compliance breaches, and reputational exposure. Systems can also generate automation debt: a growing tangle of interconnected bots that become difficult to monitor or update as business processes evolve.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe issue of necessary organisational change is troubling on two counts, furthermore. Most business processes have evolved a particular way for good reasons, so why change them to implement a new, largely unproven technology? Secondly, what&#8217;s often proposed is change that&#8217;s instigated by technology implementation. Shouldn&#8217;t processes change for strategic reasons, and technology support that change? Is this a case of the IT tail wagging the business dog?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSecurity remains a further concern. Each agent increases the surface area for potential breaches or data misuse, particularly when they are designed to communicate and collaborate autonomously. As more workflows become self-directed, ensuring traceability and accountability becomes essential, and more difficult to unpick as complexity increases. The necessary headcount to monitor results and ensure rigorous oversight could negate any ROI agentic AI offers.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Why agentic AI attracts enterprises</h3>\\n<p>\\nDespite the challenges, the attraction is easy to understand. A successful agentic system can transform the speed at which an enterprise experiments and scales. By delegating repeatable cognitive tasks \u2013 from compliance checks to customer service triage \u2013 organisations can redirect human activity elsewhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDruid\u2019s Virtual Authoring Teams encapsulate the logic: automate the automation. Its marketplace of domain-specific agents offers enterprises a head start, promising faster deployments and measurable ROI. For sectors struggling with talent shortages and regulatory pressure, that is an appealing prospect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoreover, Druid\u2019s emphasis on explainable AI and its orchestration layer suggests an awareness of corporate caution. Its stated pillars \u2013 control, accuracy, and results \u2013 are designed to reassure boards that transparency can coexist with speed. If the system truly delivers what the company claims, it could narrow the gap between AI experimentation and scalable transformation.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Balancing autonomy with accountability</h3>\\n<p>\\nStill, for every organisation embracing agentic AI, another remains unconvinced. Many enterprises are wary of over-promising vendors and pilot fatigue. A technology capable of designing and deploying its own successors raises operational questions. What happens when an agent acts beyond its creator\u2019s intent? How do governance frameworks keep pace?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBusiness leaders must treat autonomy as a spectrum, not a goal. The near future of enterprise AI will likely blend human-supervised automation with limited agentic autonomy. Systems like Druid\u2019s may act as orchestration hubs rather than fully independent actors.\\n</p>\\n<h3>From hype to utility</h3>\\n<p>\\nAgentic AI represents a natural evolution of automation in a wild frontier. Its potential is obvious, yet the market still lacks broad, evidence-based validation of sustained business outcomes. It may just be early days, or may be hyperbole drowning out the voices of reason.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor now, agentic systems <i>do work</i> in controlled contexts \u2013 contact-centre operations, document processing, and IT service management. Scaling agentic AI across organisations will require maturity not just in technology, but in culture, process design, and methods of oversight.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs Druid and its peers expand their offerings, enterprises will need to weigh the cost of control against the promised wins from better automation.

Druid AI unveils AI agent &#8216;factory&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com\\">AI News</a>.</p>\\n","content:encodedSnippet":"At its London Symbiosis 4 event on 22 October, Druid AI introduced what it terms Virtual Authoring Teams \u2013 a new generation of AI agents that can design, test, and deploy other AI agents. The announcement marks a move towards what the company calls a \u2018factory model\u2019 for AI automation.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Druid, the system enables organisations to build enterprise-grade AI agents up to ten times faster, and the platform offers orchestration facilities, plus compliance safeguards and measurable ROI tracking. The orchestration engine, Druid Conductor, serves as a control layer that integrates data, tooling, and human oversight into a single framework.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the Druid Conductor is the Druid Agentic Marketplace, a repository of pre-built, industry-specific agents for banking, healthcare, education, and insurance. With its solutions, Druid wants to make agentic AI accessible to non-technical users, but provide scalability capability suitable for enterprise use.\\n\\n\\nChief Executive Joe Kim described it as \u201cAI [that] actually works\u201d \u2013 a bold claim in a market flooded with experimentation and unproven automation frameworks.\\n\\nThe new agentic battleground\\nThe business case \u2013 and the caveats\\ncan achieve savings, could drive faster operations, and so on.\\n\\n\\nBusiness leaders should approach such systems with a clear head. There are few proven case studies beyond pilot programmes inside large corporations (those with mature data governance and deep budgets), and even in those organisations, the returns have been uneven. Failures are rarely shouted from the rooftops, after all.\\n\\n\\nThe biggest risks are not technical \u2013 they\u2019re organisational. Delegating complex decision-making to automated agents without sufficient oversight introduces potential bias, compliance breaches, and reputational exposure. Systems can also generate automation debt: a growing tangle of interconnected bots that become difficult to monitor or update as business processes evolve.\\n\\n\\nThe issue of necessary organisational change is troubling on two counts, furthermore. Most business processes have evolved a particular way for good reasons, so why change them to implement a new, largely unproven technology? Secondly, what\u2019s often proposed is change that\u2019s instigated by technology implementation. Shouldn\u2019t processes change for strategic reasons, and technology support that change? Is this a case of the IT tail wagging the business dog?\\n\\n\\nSecurity remains a further concern. Each agent increases the surface area for potential breaches or data misuse, particularly when they are designed to communicate and collaborate autonomously. As more workflows become self-directed, ensuring traceability and accountability becomes essential, and more difficult to unpick as complexity increases. The necessary headcount to monitor results and ensure rigorous oversight could negate any ROI agentic AI offers.\\n\\nWhy agentic AI attracts enterprises\\nBalancing autonomy with accountability\\nFrom hype to utility\\ndo work in controlled contexts \u2013 contact-centre operations, document processing, and IT service management. Scaling agentic AI across organisations will require maturity not just in technology, but in culture, process design, and methods of oversight.\\n\\n\\nAs Druid and its peers expand their offerings, enterprises will need to weigh the cost of control against the promised wins from better automation. The next two years will determine whether AI factories become a part of business operations, or another layer of abstraction with its own overheads.\\n\\n(Image source: \u201cBlack and grey wolf (female from Druid pack,\u2019Half Black\u2019) walking in road near Lamar River bridge\u201d by YellowstoneNPS is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0. )\\n\xa0\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that&rsquo;s a strong signal.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Local testing</strong>: Test your MCP server before publishing using the<a href=\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector\\"> MCP Inspector</a>. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Agent synergy</strong>: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Tool overload fix</strong>: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won&rsquo;t flood contexts with 90+ tools.

You need control over which servers your developers can install\u2014especially when those servers interact with sensitive data.\\nGitHub now supports registry allow lists so admins can control which MCP servers are available to developers.\\nHere are the steps for admins (which may be you!):\\nStand up or connect an internal registry that follows the MCP API spec (registry + HTTP endpoint).\\nAdd vetted MCP servers (internal + external) to your registry.\\nPoint GitHub Enterprise settings to that registry endpoint.\\nMCP-aware surfaces (starting with VS Code) enforce the allow list automatically.\\nExample: How the allow list works\\nYour internal registry at https://internal.mybank.com/mcp-registry returns:\\n{\\n  \\"servers\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/github/mcp-server\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/microsoft/markitdown-mcp\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"2.1.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"internal.mybank.com/mcp-servers/custom-tools\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.5.0\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\nWhen developers try to install an MCP server in VS Code, GitHub checks your registry endpoint and only allows installations from your approved list.\\nThis governance model means you can vet partnerships, run security scans, and maintain compliance, all while giving developers access to the tools they need.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Use GitHub\u2019s API or your existing security pipeline to vet MCP servers before adding them to your allow list.\\nTips and tricks for power users\\nOnce you\u2019ve got the basics down, here are some shortcuts to get more out of the registry:\\nSort smarter: Use GitHub stars and org verification to quickly assess quality and legitimacy. If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that\u2019s a strong signal.\\nLocal testing: Test your MCP server before publishing using the MCP Inspector. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.\xa0\\nAgent synergy: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.\\nTool overload fix: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won\u2019t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub\u2019s much more manageable.\\nWhat\u2019s next?\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s on the horizon\u2014from self-publication to enterprise adoption\u2014so you can see where the ecosystem is heading.\\nSelf-publication: Expected in the next couple months. This will unlock community-driven growth and make the registry the canonical source for all public MCP servers.\\nMore IDE support: Other IDEs are coming. The goal is to make MCP server installation seamless regardless of where you write code.\\nEnterprise features: Governance flows to help unlock MCP usage in regulated industries. Think financial services, healthcare, and other sectors where compliance isn\u2019t negotiable.\\nAgentic workflows: GitHub MCP server will start bundling tools into use-case-driven flows (e.g., \u201canalyze repository + open pull request\u201d) instead of just exposing raw API endpoints. This will make complex workflows feel like simple commands.\\nGet started today\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry has 44 servers today and will continue growing (trust us!).\\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore the MCP Registry on GitHub\\n\ud83d\udc49 To nominate your server now, email partnerships@github.com.\\nSoon, this registry will become the single source of truth for MCP servers, giving you one place to discover, install, and govern tools without hopping across outdated registries.\\nThe future of AI-assisted development isn\u2019t about coding faster. It\u2019s about orchestrating tools that amplify your impact.

We collect structured feedback on readability, trust, and &ldquo;taste.&rdquo; Part of this process includes working with language experts to improve overall completion quality. This is unique: while execution-based testing, LLM-based evaluations, dogfood testing, and A/B testing are common, we find language-specific evaluations lead to better outcomes along quality and style preferences.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-3-production-based-evaluations-a-b-testing-nbsp\\">3) Production-based evaluations: A/B testing&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ultimately, the lived experience of developers like you is what matters most.

Before fine-tuning, we build a code-specific foundational model via mid-training using a curated, de-duplicated corpus of modern, idiomatic, public, and internal code with nearly 10M repositories and 600-plus programming languages. (Mid-training refers to the stage after the base model has been pretrained on a very large, diverse corpus, but before it undergoes final fine-tuning or instruction-tuning).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is a critical step to ensure behaviors, new language syntax, and recent API versions are utilized by the model. We then use supervised fine-<s> </s>tuning and reinforcement learning while mixing objectives beyond next-token prediction&mdash;span infillings and docstring/function pairs&mdash;so the model learns structure, naming, and intent, not just next-token prediction. This helps us make the foundational model code-fluent, style-consistent, and context-aware, ready for more targeted fine-tuning via supervised fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-supervised-fine-tuning-nbsp\\">Supervised fine-tuning&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Newer general-purpose chat models perform well in natural language to generate code, but underperform on fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code completion. In practice, chat models experience cursor-misaligned inserts, duplication of code before the cursor (prefix), and overwrites of code after the cursor (suffix).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we moved to fine-tuned behaviors, we trained models specialized in completions by way of synthetic fine-tuning to behave like a great FIM engine. In practice, this improves:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Prefix/suffix awareness</strong>: Accurate inserts between tokens, mid-line continuations, full line completions, and multi-line block completions without trampling the suffix.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Formatting fidelity</strong>: Respect local style (indentation, imports, docstrings) and avoid prefix duplication.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The result is significantly improved FIM performance.

To ensure the best possible outcomes, we run an independent LLM to score completions across three axes:\xa0\xa0\\nQuality: Ensure syntax validity, duplication/overlap, format and style consistency.\xa0\\nRelevance: Focus on relevant code, avoid hallucination and overreach.\xa0\\nHelpfulness: Reduce manual effort, avoid outdated or deprecated APIs.\xa0\\n2) Pre-production evaluations: Qualitative dogfooding\xa0\\nOur next step includes working with internal developers and partners to test models side-by-side in real workflows (to do the latter, we exposed the preview model to developers through Copilot\u2019s model picker). We collect structured feedback on readability, trust, and \u201ctaste.\u201d Part of this process includes working with language experts to improve overall completion quality. This is unique: while execution-based testing, LLM-based evaluations, dogfood testing, and A/B testing are common, we find language-specific evaluations lead to better outcomes along quality and style preferences.\xa0\\n3) Production-based evaluations: A/B testing\xa0\\nUltimately, the lived experience of developers like you is what matters most. We measure improvements using accepted-and-retained characters, acceptance rates, completion-shown rate, time-to-first token, latency, and many other metrics. We ship only when statistically significant improvements hold up under real developer workloads.\xa0\\nHow we trained our new Copilot completions model\xa0\\nMid-training\xa0\\nModern codebases use modern APIs. Before fine-tuning, we build a code-specific foundational model via mid-training using a curated, de-duplicated corpus of modern, idiomatic, public, and internal code with nearly 10M repositories and 600-plus programming languages. (Mid-training refers to the stage after the base model has been pretrained on a very large, diverse corpus, but before it undergoes final fine-tuning or instruction-tuning).\xa0\\nThis is a critical step to ensure behaviors, new language syntax, and recent API versions are utilized by the model. We then use supervised fine- tuning and reinforcement learning while mixing objectives beyond next-token prediction\u2014span infillings and docstring/function pairs\u2014so the model learns structure, naming, and intent, not just next-token prediction. This helps us make the foundational model code-fluent, style-consistent, and context-aware, ready for more targeted fine-tuning via supervised fine-tuning.\xa0\\nSupervised fine-tuning\xa0\\nNewer general-purpose chat models perform well in natural language to generate code, but underperform on fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code completion. In practice, chat models experience cursor-misaligned inserts, duplication of code before the cursor (prefix), and overwrites of code after the cursor (suffix).\xa0\xa0\\nAs we moved to fine-tuned behaviors, we trained models specialized in completions by way of synthetic fine-tuning to behave like a great FIM engine. In practice, this improves:\xa0\\nPrefix/suffix awareness: Accurate inserts between tokens, mid-line continuations, full line completions, and multi-line block completions without trampling the suffix.\xa0\\nFormatting fidelity: Respect local style (indentation, imports, docstrings) and avoid prefix duplication.\xa0\\nThe result is significantly improved FIM performance. For example, here is a benchmark comparing our latest completions model to GPT-4.1-mini on OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Infilling Benchmarks.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning\xa0\\nFinally, we used a custom reinforcement learning algorithm, teaching the model through rewards and penalties to internalize what makes code suggestions useful in real developer scenarios along three axes:\\nQuality: Syntax-valid, compilable code that follows project style (indentations, imports, headers).\xa0\xa0\\nRelevance: On-task suggestions that respect surrounding context and the file\u2019s intent.\xa0\xa0\\nHelpfulness: Suggestions that reduce manual effort and prefer modern APIs.\xa0\xa0\\nTogether, these create completions that are correct, relevant, and genuinely useful at the cursor instead of being verbose or superficially helpful.\xa0\\nWhat we learned\xa0\\nAfter talking with programming language experts and finding success in our prompt-based approach, one of our most important lessons was adding related files like C++ header files to our training data. Beyond this, we also came away with three key learnings:\xa0\\nReward carefully: Early reinforcement learning version over-optimized for longer completions, adding too many comments in the form of \u201creward hacking.\u201d To mitigate this problem, we introduced comment guardrails to keep completions concise and focused on moving the task forward while penalizing unnecessary commentary.\xa0\\nMetrics matter: Being hyper-focused on a metric like acceptance rate can lead to experiences that look good on paper, but do not result in happy developers. That makes it critical to evaluate performance by monitoring multiple metrics with real-world impact.\\nTrain for real-world usage: We align our synthetic fine-tuning data with real-world usage and adapt our training accordingly. This helps us identify problematic patterns and remove them via training to improve real-world outcomes.\xa0\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next\xa0\\nWe\u2019re continuing to push the frontier of Copilot completions by:\xa0\\nExpanding into domain-specific slices (e.g., game engines, financial, ERP).\xa0\\nRefining reward functions for build/test success, semantic usefulness (edits that advance the user\u2019s intent without bloat), and API modernity preference for up-to-date, idiomatic libraries and patterns. This is helping us shape completion behavior with greater precision.\xa0\\nDriving faster, cheaper, higher-quality completions across all developer environments.\xa0\xa0\\nExperience faster, smarter code completions yourself.

You know how it goes: you start by asking \u201cwhat if?\u201d and then you have something weird and wonderful hours later.\xa0\\nThis summer, we decided to celebrate that spirit with For the Love of Code, our first-ever competition for projects built purely for fun. More than 300 developers answered the call. Some leaned on GitHub Copilot to refactor ideas, fix bugs, and spark inspiration. Some teamed up. Others flew solo, guided only by caffeine and curiosity.\\nEntries spanned everything from a Breakout game powered by your GitHub graph, to a laugh-track that plays on every commit, a Yelp-style code reviewer in VS Code \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606, a Copilot you can literally see on camera, and even a comic strip made from your release notes.\\nWe invited participants to build anything that sparks joy across six whimsical categories:\\n\ud83d\udd18 Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights: Hardware hacks, LEDs, sensors, and gadgets galore.\\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Terminal talent: Command-line creations and retro computing love letters.\\n\ud83c\udf10 World wide wonders: Browser-based experiments, apps, and interactive art.\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents of change: AI, bots, and automation with heart.\\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Game on: Games big or small, serious or silly.\\n\ud83c\udccf Everything but the kitchen sink: The wildcard (if it doesn\u2019t fit anywhere else, it fits here).\\n\ud83d\udca1 How GitHub Copilot powered creativity\\nGitHub Copilot helped contest participants:\\nCreate efficient Go code to integrate with the GitHub API\\nScaffold repetitive code and boilerplate\\nSuggest API calls and syntax corrections\\nDebug hardware quirks and runtime errors\\nSpark inspiration for algorithms and UI design\\nWrite their first Python program\\nMake their first real push to GitHub\\nAnd it didn\u2019t stop there. When creativity met Copilot, side projects turned into something spectacular.\\nDiscover how Copilot can help you with your project >\\nMeet the winners: Open source experiments, AI side projects, and more\\nHere are the top three entries from each category.\\n\ud83d\udd18 Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights\xa0\\nPlane Tracker: DIY radar on your desk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlane Tracker by @cpstroum is a DIY radar that uses an Adafruit Circuit Playground, Bluetooth, and the ADS-B Exchange API to fetch live flight data. It turns nearby planes into a real-time mini radar display.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @cpstroum with Git itself and with structuring the initial project for their first real push to GitHub. Thanks, Copilot! And welcome aboard, @cpstroum!\\n\\n\\n\\nCadrephoto: The easy e-ink photo frame\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCadrephoto by @ozh is a Raspberry Pi and e-ink photo frame that displays pictures emailed to it (no app, no setup, perfect for less tech-savvy people). It checks an inbox, downloads the latest photo, and updates the screen automatically.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @ozh with their first Python project. It worked smoothly inside JetBrains IDEs and made code completion feel almost like magic.\\n\\n\\n\\nBuildIn: Traffic-light builds for your repository\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuildIn by @SUNSET-Sejong-University and @lepetitprince99 is a real-life traffic light for your code that sits on your desk. Using an Arduino and the GitHub API, it lights up red, yellow, green, or blue to show your repository\u2019s build status at a glance.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @SUNSET-Sejong-University debug and optimize their code. It saved time tracking down tricky hardware issues and made troubleshooting much easier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Terminal talent\\nRestoHack: A roguelike resurrected from 1984\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRestoHack by @Critlist resurrects the 1984 roguelike game that inspired NetHack, rebuilt from the original source with modern tools and a preservationist\u2019s touch. It compiles cleanly, runs faithfully, and proves that forty years later, permadeath still hits hard.\\nJukebox CLI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJukebox CLI by @FedeCarollo is a colorful, animated jukebox that runs right in your terminal. Built in Rust with Ratatui, it plays MP3s, shows floating musical notes, and color-codes each track in a scrollable playlist. You can play, pause, skip, and adjust the volume without ever leaving your command line.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @FedeCarollo explore unfamiliar Rust libraries and find their footing.\\n\\n\\n\\nTuneminal: Sing your commits from the command line\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuneminal by @heza-ru turns your terminal into a full-blown karaoke stage with scrolling lyrics, live audio visualization, and scoring that rewards your inner rock star. It\u2019s open source, cross-platform, and the perfect excuse to sing while that git clone takes a while.\\n\ud83c\udf10 World wide wonders\\nNetstalgia: Surf the \u201890s web on virtual dial-up\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetstalgia by @heza-ru (again!) is a fully functional \u201890s web fever dream built with modern tech, but visually stuck on virtual dial-up. It\u2019s got dancing babies, popup ads, a fake BBS, and more CRT glow than your old Gateway 2000 ever survived.\\nIn true retro internet spirit, it even ships with a fake GitHub Star Ransomware\u2014a tongue-in-cheek \u201cvirus\u201d that demands you star the repo to \u201cdecrypt your files.\u201d A clever (and harmless) new twist on the eternal quest for GitHub stars. \u2b50\ud83d\udcbe\\nBionic Reader: Speed read your screen\\nBionic Reader by @Awesome-XV rewires how you read by bolding the first few letters of each word so your brain fills in the rest. It\u2019s like giving your eyes a speed boost without the caffeine jitters to read faster than ever.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @Awesome-XV write project documentation and scaffold the initial codebase.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Git Roast Show: Roast your GitHub profile\u2026 lovingly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGit Roast Show by @rawrnuck and @Anmol0201 is a full-stack web app that humorously \u201croasts\u201d your GitHub profile. Built with React, Vite, and Express, it fetches live GitHub data to generate personalized, sound-enhanced, and animated comedy roasts.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @rawrnuck understand algorithms and handle the repetitive parts of their project.\\n\\n\\n\\nNightlio: a mood tracker you actually own\\nNightlio by @shirsakm is a privacy-first mood tracker and daily journal you can self-host in minutes. Log how you feel on a 5-point scale, add Markdown notes, tag entries like #Sleep or #Productivity, then explore calendars, streaks, and simple stats to spot patterns. It runs anywhere with Docker, stores data in a local SQLite file, and keeps things clean with JWT-protected APIs, a React/Vite front end, and optional Google OAuth. No ads. No subscriptions. Your server, your rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Because @heza-ru placed in two categories, we\u2019ve added a fourth winner to this category.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @shirsakm with refactors, color palette updates, and codebase-wide changes that would have taken much longer by hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents of change\\nNeosgenesis: AI that thinks about thinking\\nNeosgenesis by @answeryt is a metacognitive AI framework that teaches machines to think about how they think. It runs a five-stage loop (think, verify, learn, optimize, decide) while juggling multiple LLMs, tools, and real-time feedback. A multi-armed bandit picks the best reasoning patterns, and when it stalls, an \u201caha\u201d mode explores fresh paths.\\nMediVision Assistant: Accessible AI healthcare for all\\nMediVision Assistant by @omkardongre is an AI healthcare companion that helps elderly and disabled users manage their health through voice, image, and video. Users can scan medications, analyze skin conditions, log symptoms by voice, and chat with an AI doctor-like assistant.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @omkardongre generate React components, API templates, and AI integration code. It handled the boilerplate so they could focus on building features and improving the experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuiviva: The r\xe9sum\xe9 that talks back\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuiviva by @katawiecz is an interactive AI-powered CV that turns a job hunt into a chat adventure. Ask about skills or projects, or type \u201cGandalf\u201d to unlock secret nerd mode. All this goes to show that even r\xe9sum\xe9s can be fun.\\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Game on\\nAI-Dventure: Infinite worlds, infinite choices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI-Dventure by @FedeCarollo is an interactive text adventure built in Rust and powered by OpenAI\u2019s models. Players explore dynamically generated worlds in fantasy, horror, sci-fi, or historical settings where every command shapes the story and no two runs are the same.\\nBeatBugging: Debug to the beat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeatBugging by @sandra-aliaga, @Joshep-c, @RyanValdivia, and @tniia turns debugging into a rhythm game that converts your system logs into musical beats. Built in Python, it lets you fix bugs to the rhythm on a 5-by-5 grid and makes debugging sound unexpectedly good.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped the team figure out next steps when they got stuck, offering helpful hints that kept development moving.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuMind: A multiplayer battle of wits and vibes\\nMuMind by @FontesHabana is a web-based multiplayer version of the party game Herd Mentality, where players try to match the majority\u2019s answers to score points. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, it offers multilingual support, lively animations, and a smooth, responsive experience.\\n\ud83c\udccf Everything but the kitchen sink\\nGitFrag: Defrag your contributions graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@chornonoh-vova built GitFrag to reorganize your contributions graph using classic sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick, and counting sort).

Every emoji, comment, and code critique earns points on a live leaderboard that turns pull request reviews into a friendly competition.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @master-wayne7 write efficient Go code for the GitHub API, structure logic for assigning karma points, and handle repetitive tasks like error checking and markdown generation. It kept the project flowing smoothly from start to finish.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese projects show what\u2019s possible when we let our curiosity take center stage\\nRemember these are hackathon projects. They might not be feature complete, there may be bugs, spaghetti code, and the occasional rogue program escaped from the Grid. But they are clear examples of what we can accomplish when we do something just for the love of it.\\nAll of our category winners get 12 months of GitHub Copilot Pro+.\\nIf For the Love of Code proved anything, it\u2019s that creativity and code thrive best together\u2014especially with Copilot lending a hand.\\nShoutout to the makers\\nCongratulations to all of our winners: @Anmol0201, @answeryt, @Awesome-XV, @chornonoh-vova, @cpstroum, @Critlist, @FedeCarollo, @FontesHabana, @heza-ru, @joshep-c, @katawiecz, @lepetitprince99, @master-wayne7, @omkardongre, @RyanValdivia, @ozh, @rawrnuck, @redhatsam09, @sandra-aliaga, @shirsakm, @SUNSET-Sejong-University, @tniia.\\nMassive thank you to our judges, which included a mix of GitHub Stars, Campus Experts, and GitHub Developer Relations friends: @Ba4bes, @colbyfayock, @j0ashm, @JuanGdev, @howard-lio, @luckyjoseph, @metzinaround, @Taiwrash, and @xavidop.\\nAnd thank you Copilot for your assistance!\\nNow back to work everyone!

If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that&rsquo;s a strong signal.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Local testing</strong>: Test your MCP server before publishing using the<a href=\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector\\"> MCP Inspector</a>. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Agent synergy</strong>: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Tool overload fix</strong>: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won&rsquo;t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub&rsquo;s much more manageable.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"whats-next\\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started. Here&rsquo;s a look at what&rsquo;s on the horizon&mdash;from self-publication to enterprise adoption&mdash;so you can see where the ecosystem is heading.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Self-publication</strong>: Expected in the next couple months. This will unlock community-driven growth and make the registry the canonical source for all public MCP servers.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>More IDE support</strong>: Other IDEs are coming.

The cereal is scattered across three aisles. The milk is hiding in some random cooler near self-checkout. And those produce labels? They haven\u2019t been updated in months.\\nThat\u2019s exactly what discovering Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers felt like. Until now.\\nAs a refresher, MCP is how developers connect tools, APIs, and workflows to their AI systems. Each MCP server is like an ingredient in your AI stack, whether it\u2019s Playwright for browser automation, Notion for knowledge access, or GitHub\u2019s own MCP server with over a hundred tools.\xa0\\nThe new GitHub MCP Registry changes everything by giving you a single, canonical source for discovering, installing, and managing MCP servers right on GitHub.\\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about finding the right tools for your AI stack, publishing your own servers, and setting up governance for your team.\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll walk through how to:\\nInstall an MCP server\\nPublish your own\\nEnable governance and team use\\nWe\u2019ll also share a few tips and tricks for power users. Let\u2019s go!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\u2019s in the registry today\\nCurrently, the GitHub MCP Registry has 44 MCP servers, including:\\nPlaywright: Automate and test web apps.\\nGitHub MCP server: Access 100+ GitHub API tools.\\nContext7, MarkItDown (Microsoft), Terraform (HashiCorp).\\nPartner servers from Notion, Unity, Firecrawl, Stripe, and more.\\nYou can browse by tags, popularity, or GitHub stars to find the tools you need.\\nHow to install an MCP server\\nThe registry makes installation a one-click experience in VS Code or VS Code Insiders.\\nExample: Installing Playwright\\nNavigate to Playwright MCP server in the GitHub MCP Registry.\\nClick Install in VS Code.\\nVS Code launches with a pre-filled configuration.\\nAccept or adjust optional parameters (like storage paths).\\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready to use Playwright in your agentic workflows.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Remote MCP servers (like GitHub\u2019s) use OAuth during install so you don\u2019t need to manually handle tokens or secrets. Just authenticate once and start building.\\nHow to publish your own MCP server\\n1. Install the MCP Publisher CLI\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (Homebrew, recommended):\\nbrew install mcp-publisher\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (prebuilt binary, latest version):\\n\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher && sudo mv mcp-publisher /usr/local/bin/\\n2. Initialize your server.json file\\nNavigate to your server\u2019s source directory and run:\\ncd /path/to/your/mcp-server\\nmcp-publisher init\\nThis creates a server.json file. Example:\\n{\\n  \\"$schema\\": \\"https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-09-29/server.schema.json\\",\\n  \\"name\\": \\"io.github.yourname/your-server\\",\\n  \\"title\\": \\"Describe Your Server\\",\\n  \\"description\\": \\"A description of your MCP server\\",\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n  \\"packages\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"registryType\\": \\"npm\\",\\n      \\"identifier\\": \\"your-package-name\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n      \\"transport\\": { \\"type\\": \\"stdio\\" }\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n3. Prove you own the package\\nAdd the required metadata for your package type.\\nNPM: Add an \\"mcpName\\" field to your package.json:\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"your-npm-package\\",\\n  \\"mcpName\\": \\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n}\\nPyPI/NuGet: Add this to your README:\\nmcp-name: io.github.username/server-name\\nDocker: Add a label to your Dockerfile:\\nLABEL io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name=\\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n4. Authentication\\nFor GitHub-based namespaces (io.github.*), run:\\nmcp-publisher login github\\n       This will open a browser for OAuth login.\\nFor custom domains (com.yourcompany/*), follow DNS verification steps in the official docs.\\n5. Publish your server\\nOnce authenticated, publish to the registry:\\nmcp-publisher publish\\nIf successful, your server will be discoverable in the MCP registry. You can verify with:\\ncurl \\"https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=io.github.yourname/your-server\\"\\nOnce you\u2019ve completed the steps above, email\xa0partnerships@github.com\xa0and request for your server to be included.\\n\u2705 Pro tips:\xa0\\nNamespace: Use io.github.username/* for GitHub auth, or com.yourcompany/* for DNS-based verification.\\nRemote endpoints: Add a \\"remotes\\" array in your server.json for cloud/HTTP endpoints:\\n\\"remotes\\": [\\n  {\\n    \\"type\\": \\"streamable-http\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://yourdomain.com/yourserver\\"\\n  }\\n]\\nMultiple deployment options: You can list both \\"packages\\" and \\"remotes\\" for hybrid deployments.\\nExamples: See airtable-mcp-server (npm/docker/MCPB), time-mcp-nuget, time-mcp-pypi.\\nAutomate publishing with GitHub Actions\\nYou can automate publishing so every tagged release is published to both your package registry and the MCP registry.\\nCreate .github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml:\\nname: Publish to MCP Registry\\non:\\n  push:\\n    tags: [\\"v*\\"]\\n\\njobs:\\n  publish:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    permissions:\\n      id-token: write  # For OIDC\\n      contents: read\\n\\n    steps:\\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\\n\\n      # (Edit these for your package type)\\n      - name: Setup Node.js\\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v5\\n        with:\\n          node-version: \\"lts/*\\"\\n      - name: Install dependencies\\n        run: npm ci\\n      - name: Build and test\\n        run: |\\n          npm run build --if-present\\n          npm run test --if-present\\n      - name: Publish to npm\\n        run: npm publish\\n        env:\\n          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\\n\\n      # MCP publishing (works for all package types)\\n      - name: Download MCP Publisher\\n        run: |\\n          curl -L \\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher\\n      - name: Publish to MCP Registry\\n        run: |\\n          ./mcp-publisher login github-oidc\\n          ./mcp-publisher publish\\n\\n      # Optional: keep server.json version in sync with git tag\\n      - run: |\\n          VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}\\n          jq --arg v \\"$VERSION\\" \'.version = $v\' server.json > tmp && mv tmp server.json\\nTo trigger the workflow:\\ngit tag v1.0.0\\ngit push origin v1.0.0\\nWhen you publish, your server shows up in the open source registry and downstream registries (like GitHub\u2019s) automatically pick up updates. No more notifying a dozen different registries every time you ship a new version.\\n\u2705 Pro tips:\\nHost your code in a public GitHub repository to show verified ownership.\\nAdd tags in server.json so developers can easily discover your server by category.\\nUpdates propagate automatically downstream\u2014no manual notifications required\\nHow to manage MCP servers in the enterprise\\nIf you\u2019re managing MCP usage across a large organization, governance isn\u2019t optional. You need control over which servers your developers can install\u2014especially when those servers interact with sensitive data.\\nGitHub now supports registry allow lists so admins can control which MCP servers are available to developers.\\nHere are the steps for admins (which may be you!):\\nStand up or connect an internal registry that follows the MCP API spec (registry + HTTP endpoint).\\nAdd vetted MCP servers (internal + external) to your registry.\\nPoint GitHub Enterprise settings to that registry endpoint.\\nMCP-aware surfaces (starting with VS Code) enforce the allow list automatically.\\nExample: How the allow list works\\nYour internal registry at https://internal.mybank.com/mcp-registry returns:\\n{\\n  \\"servers\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/github/mcp-server\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/microsoft/markitdown-mcp\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"2.1.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"internal.mybank.com/mcp-servers/custom-tools\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.5.0\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\nWhen developers try to install an MCP server in VS Code, GitHub checks your registry endpoint and only allows installations from your approved list.\\nThis governance model means you can vet partnerships, run security scans, and maintain compliance, all while giving developers access to the tools they need.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Use GitHub\u2019s API or your existing security pipeline to vet MCP servers before adding them to your allow list.\\nTips and tricks for power users\\nOnce you\u2019ve got the basics down, here are some shortcuts to get more out of the registry:\\nSort smarter: Use GitHub stars and org verification to quickly assess quality and legitimacy. If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that\u2019s a strong signal.\\nLocal testing: Test your MCP server before publishing using the MCP Inspector. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.\xa0\\nAgent synergy: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.\\nTool overload fix: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won\u2019t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub\u2019s much more manageable.\\nWhat\u2019s next?\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s on the horizon\u2014from self-publication to enterprise adoption\u2014so you can see where the ecosystem is heading.\\nSelf-publication: Expected in the next couple months. This will unlock community-driven growth and make the registry the canonical source for all public MCP servers.\\nMore IDE support: Other IDEs are coming. The goal is to make MCP server installation seamless regardless of where you write code.\\nEnterprise features: Governance flows to help unlock MCP usage in regulated industries. Think financial services, healthcare, and other sectors where compliance isn\u2019t negotiable.\\nAgentic workflows: GitHub MCP server will start bundling tools into use-case-driven flows (e.g., \u201canalyze repository + open pull request\u201d) instead of just exposing raw API endpoints. This will make complex workflows feel like simple commands.\\nGet started today\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry has 44 servers today and will continue growing (trust us!).\\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore the MCP Registry on GitHub\\n\ud83d\udc49 To nominate your server now, email partnerships@github.com.\\nSoon, this registry will become the single source of truth for MCP servers, giving you one place to discover, install, and govern tools without hopping across outdated registries.\\nThe future of AI-assisted development isn\u2019t about coding faster. It\u2019s about orchestrating tools that amplify your impact. And the GitHub MCP Registry is where that orchestration begins.\\n\\nThe post How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"Andrea Griffiths","description":"<p>Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-find-install-and-manage-mcp-servers-with-the-github-mcp-registry/\\">How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-find-install-and-manage-mcp-servers-with-the-github-mcp-registry/\\">How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.\\nThe post How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91673","categories":["AI & ML","Generative AI","MCP"],"isoDate":"2025-10-24T16:00:00.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry","publishedDate":"2025-10-24T16:00:00.000Z","author":"Andrea Griffiths","summary":"Learn how to bring structure and security to your AI ecosystem with the GitHub MCP Registry, the single source of truth for managing and governing MCP servers.\\nThe post How to find, install, and manage MCP servers with the GitHub MCP Registry appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Sergiu Gatlan","title":"Amazon: This week\u2019s AWS outage caused by major DNS failure","link":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/amazon-this-weeks-aws-outage-caused-by-major-dns-failure/","pubDate":"Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:33:58 -0400","dc:creator":"Sergiu Gatlan","description":"Amazon says a major DNS failure was behind a massive AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage that took down many websites and online services on Monday.

Even the best AI isn&#8217;t helpful if it can&#8217;t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don&#8217;t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google&#8217;s Vertex AI, Salesforce&#8217;s <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/salesforce-agentforce-3-brings-visibility-ai-agents/\\">Agentforce</a>, and AWS Bedrock.

OpenAI says it&#8217;s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"577\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg\\" alt=\\"OpenAI ChatGPT AI virtual assistant connecting to enterprise apps to surface company knowledge.\\" class=\\"wp-image-110019\\" srcset=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1536x865.jpeg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.jpeg 1920w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis. For example, a manager prepping for a client call could ask for a briefing. The model could then use recent Slack messages, email details, call notes from Google Docs, and support tickets from Intercom to make a summary.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This power can also handle confusion. If you ask, \u201cWhat are the company goals for next year?\u201d, the tool will summarise what&#8217;s been talked about and point out different opinions. This goes beyond just finding data; now it&#8217;s analysing situations and helping leaders find disagreements or unfinished decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other uses for teams:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Putting together customer feedback from Slack, survey results from Google Slides, and main topics from support tickets to plan roadmaps.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Making campaign summaries by getting data from HubSpot, briefs from Google Docs, and key points from emails.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Planning:</strong> Helping engineering leads plan releases by checking GitHub for open tasks, checking Linear for tickets, and checking Slack for bug reports.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-addressing-enterprise-ai-governance-and-implementation\\">Addressing enterprise AI governance and implementation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For CISOs and data leaders, sharing intellectual property with an AI model is a big risk. OpenAI is dealing with this by focusing on admin controls and data privacy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most important control is that the system respects your current company permissions. OpenAI has ensured that ChatGPT can only see the enterprise data that each user can already see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu admins can manage access to apps and create custom roles. OpenAI says it doesn&#8217;t train on your data by default. It also has security features like encryption, SSO, SCIM, IP whitelisting, and a Compliance API for logs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But, tech leaders should know the limits. It&#8217;s not perfect yet. Users have to pick it when starting a conversation. Also, there&#8217;s a trade-off: when company knowledge is on, ChatGPT can&#8217;t search the web or make charts. OpenAI is working to fix this soon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The tool&#8217;s usefulness depends on its ecosystem. It&#8217;s launching with key platforms and adding connectors for tools like Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, copying the strategies of IBM watsonx and SAP Joule.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI&#8217;s enterprise data knowledge surfacing is the next step for AI assistants like ChatGPT, moving them into the private core of businesses.

Even the best AI isn\u2019t helpful if it can\u2019t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.\\nThis scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don\u2019t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.\\nThis puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google\u2019s Vertex AI, Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.\\nOpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks\\nChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it\u2019s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis. For example, a manager prepping for a client call could ask for a briefing. The model could then use recent Slack messages, email details, call notes from Google Docs, and support tickets from Intercom to make a summary.\\nThis power can also handle confusion. If you ask, \u201cWhat are the company goals for next year?\u201d, the tool will summarise what\u2019s been talked about and point out different opinions. This goes beyond just finding data; now it\u2019s analysing situations and helping leaders find disagreements or unfinished decisions.\\nOther uses for teams:\\nStrategy: Putting together customer feedback from Slack, survey results from Google Slides, and main topics from support tickets to plan roadmaps.\\nReporting: Making campaign summaries by getting data from HubSpot, briefs from Google Docs, and key points from emails.\\nPlanning: Helping engineering leads plan releases by checking GitHub for open tasks, checking Linear for tickets, and checking Slack for bug reports.\\nAddressing enterprise AI governance and implementation\\nFor CISOs and data leaders, sharing intellectual property with an AI model is a big risk. OpenAI is dealing with this by focusing on admin controls and data privacy.\\nThe most important control is that the system respects your current company permissions. OpenAI has ensured that ChatGPT can only see the enterprise data that each user can already see.\\nChatGPT Enterprise and Edu admins can manage access to apps and create custom roles. OpenAI says it doesn\u2019t train on your data by default. It also has security features like encryption, SSO, SCIM, IP whitelisting, and a Compliance API for logs.\\nBut, tech leaders should know the limits. It\u2019s not perfect yet. Users have to pick it when starting a conversation. Also, there\u2019s a trade-off: when company knowledge is on, ChatGPT can\u2019t search the web or make charts. OpenAI is working to fix this soon.\\nThe tool\u2019s usefulness depends on its ecosystem. It\u2019s launching with key platforms and adding connectors for tools like Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, copying the strategies of IBM watsonx and SAP Joule.\\nOpenAI\u2019s enterprise data knowledge surfacing is the next step for AI assistants like ChatGPT, moving them into the private core of businesses. It tries to solve the AI problem: connecting models to the data where work happens.\\nFor business leaders, this means:\\nCheck your data: Before using this, CISOs and CDAOs must check that data permissions in SharePoint, Google Drive, etc., are correct. The AI will only respect those permissions, so if they\u2019re too open, the AI will show that weakness.\\nPilot with tricky tasks: Instead of rolling it out to everyone, find specific workflows that are slowed down by scattered info. Preparing client briefings or making cross-department reports are good places to start measuring results.\\nSet expectations: Teams must know the limits. Having to manually turn it on and not being able to search the web at the same time are big limits to consider.\\nWatch the ecosystem: The tool\u2019s value will depend on its integrations. CIOs should compare the tool\u2019s connector list to their company\u2019s tech.\\nCompare to current platforms: See how this compares to the AI solutions from Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce. The decision is quickly becoming about which data ecosystem offers the most secure, integrated, and cost-effective path.\\nOpenAI\u2019s new company knowledge feature shows that the most important thing for generative AI is now secure and useful data integration, not just how good the model is.\\nThis latest ChatGPT feature should make things much faster by getting rid of enterprise knowledge silos, but it also makes data governance and access control more important than ever.

Our team has continuously iterated on the custom models powering the completions experience in GitHub Copilot driven by developer feedback. That work has had a big impact on giving you faster, more relevant suggestions in the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&rsquo;re now delivering suggestions with 20% more accepted and retained characters, 12% higher acceptance rate, 3x higher token-per-second throughput, and a 35% reduction in latency.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These updates now power GitHub Copilot across editors and environments.

The original Copilot was optimized for the highest acceptance rate possible. However, we realized that a heavy focus on acceptance rates could lead to incorrectly favoring a high volume of simple and short suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We heard your feedback that this didn&rsquo;t reflect real developer needs or deliver the highest quality experience. So, we pivoted to also optimize for accepted and retained characters, code flow, and other metrics.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>20% higher accepted-and-retained characters</strong> results in more of each Copilot suggestion staying in your final code, not just ending up temporarily accepted and deleted later. In other words, suggestions provide more value with fewer keystrokes.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>12% higher acceptance rate</strong> means you find suggestions more useful more often, reflecting better immediate utility.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>3x throughput</strong> <strong>with 35% lower latency</strong> makes Copilot feel faster. It handles more requests at once while keeping your coding flow unbroken (throughput describes how much work the system can handle overall, while latency describes how quickly each individual request completes).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-we-evaluate-custom-models-nbsp\\">How we evaluate custom models&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copilot models are evaluated using combined signals from <strong>offline</strong>, <strong>pre-production</strong>, and <strong>production</strong> evaluations. Each layer helps us refine different aspects of the experience while ensuring better quality in real developer workflows.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-1-offline-evaluations-nbsp-nbsp\\">1) Offline evaluations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Execution-based benchmark: </strong>As part of our offline evaluations, we first test against internal and public repositories with strong code by unit test and scenario coverage, spanning all major languages. Each test simulates real tasks, accepts suggestions, and measures build-and-test pass rates. This emphasizes functional correctness over surface fluency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Below is an example of a partial token completion error: the model produced <code>data<strong>et</strong></code> instead of <code>data<strong>set</strong></code>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-large\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" fetchpriority=\\"high\\" decoding=\\"async\\" height=\\"447\\" width=\\"1024\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/partial-token-completion-error.png?resize=1024%2C447\\" alt=\\"Screenshot of a Python code editor showing a function named resolve_file inside a file called dataset_utilities.py.

Our team has continuously iterated on the custom models powering the completions experience in GitHub Copilot driven by developer feedback. That work has had a big impact on giving you faster, more relevant suggestions in the editor.\xa0\xa0\\nWe\u2019re now delivering suggestions with 20% more accepted and retained characters, 12% higher acceptance rate, 3x higher token-per-second throughput, and a 35% reduction in latency.\xa0\\nThese updates now power GitHub Copilot across editors and environments. We\u2019d like to share our journey on how we trained and evaluated our custom model for code completions.\xa0\\nWhy it matters\xa0\\nWhen Copilot completions improve, you spend less time editing and more time building. The original Copilot was optimized for the highest acceptance rate possible. However, we realized that a heavy focus on acceptance rates could lead to incorrectly favoring a high volume of simple and short suggestions.\xa0\xa0\\nWe heard your feedback that this didn\u2019t reflect real developer needs or deliver the highest quality experience. So, we pivoted to also optimize for accepted and retained characters, code flow, and other metrics.\xa0\\n20% higher accepted-and-retained characters results in more of each Copilot suggestion staying in your final code, not just ending up temporarily accepted and deleted later. In other words, suggestions provide more value with fewer keystrokes.\\n12% higher acceptance rate means you find suggestions more useful more often, reflecting better immediate utility.\xa0\\n3x throughput with 35% lower latency makes Copilot feel faster. It handles more requests at once while keeping your coding flow unbroken (throughput describes how much work the system can handle overall, while latency describes how quickly each individual request completes).\\nHow we evaluate custom models\xa0\\nCopilot models are evaluated using combined signals from offline, pre-production, and production evaluations. Each layer helps us refine different aspects of the experience while ensuring better quality in real developer workflows.\xa0\\n1) Offline evaluations\xa0\xa0\\nExecution-based benchmark: As part of our offline evaluations, we first test against internal and public repositories with strong code by unit test and scenario coverage, spanning all major languages. Each test simulates real tasks, accepts suggestions, and measures build-and-test pass rates. This emphasizes functional correctness over surface fluency.\xa0\xa0\\nBelow is an example of a partial token completion error: the model produced dataet instead of dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM-judge scoring: While we start with execution-based evaluation, this has downsides: it only tells if the code will compile, but the results are not always aligned with developer preferences. To ensure the best possible outcomes, we run an independent LLM to score completions across three axes:\xa0\xa0\\nQuality: Ensure syntax validity, duplication/overlap, format and style consistency.\xa0\\nRelevance: Focus on relevant code, avoid hallucination and overreach.\xa0\\nHelpfulness: Reduce manual effort, avoid outdated or deprecated APIs.\xa0\\n2) Pre-production evaluations: Qualitative dogfooding\xa0\\nOur next step includes working with internal developers and partners to test models side-by-side in real workflows (to do the latter, we exposed the preview model to developers through Copilot\u2019s model picker). We collect structured feedback on readability, trust, and \u201ctaste.\u201d Part of this process includes working with language experts to improve overall completion quality. This is unique: while execution-based testing, LLM-based evaluations, dogfood testing, and A/B testing are common, we find language-specific evaluations lead to better outcomes along quality and style preferences.\xa0\\n3) Production-based evaluations: A/B testing\xa0\\nUltimately, the lived experience of developers like you is what matters most. We measure improvements using accepted-and-retained characters, acceptance rates, completion-shown rate, time-to-first token, latency, and many other metrics.

Unfortunately, regular shoppers have almost no way to tell whether a store is still vulnerable or already secured.\\nFrom a consumer\u2019s point of view, SessionReaper is another reminder that even trusted stores can quietly become unsafe between page loads. When a platform as widespread as Magento is under active attack, the best defense often lies outside the store itself.\\nWatch out for odd behavior on a site or missing valid HTTPS, and don\u2019t enter payment or personal data if something seems suspicious.\\nWhere possible, opt for checkout options that use third-party gateways (like PayPal), as they\u2019re isolated from the store\u2019s servers.\\nReport suspicious e-commerce behavior to the site operator or your payment provider straight away.\\nShop on reputable sites whenever you can, or check the reviews and reputation of any new sellers before buying.\\nMake sure your operating system, browser, and anti-malware software are up to date to protect against the latest threats.\\nWe don\u2019t just report on threats\u2014we remove them\\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The announcement marks a move towards what the company calls a &#8216;factory model&#8217; for AI automation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAccording to Druid, the system enables organisations to build enterprise-grade AI agents up to ten times faster, and the platform offers orchestration facilities, plus compliance safeguards and measurable ROI tracking. The orchestration engine, Druid Conductor, serves as a control layer that integrates data, tooling, and human oversight into a single framework.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn addition to the Druid Conductor is the Druid Agentic Marketplace, a repository of pre-built, industry-specific agents for banking, healthcare, education, and insurance. With its solutions, Druid wants to make agentic AI accessible to non-technical users, but provide scalability capability suitable for enterprise use.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChief Executive Joe Kim described it as &#8220;AI [that] actually works\u201d \u2013 a bold claim in a market flooded with experimentation and unproven automation frameworks.\\n</p>\\n<h3>The new agentic battleground</h3>\\n<p>\\nDruid is not alone in its pursuit. Similar platforms, the likes of Cognigy, Kore.ai, and Amelia, each represent heavy investment in multi-agent orchestration environments. OpenAI\u2019s GPTs and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Projects also allow users to design semi-autonomous digital workers without coding expertise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGoogle\u2019s Vertex AI Agents and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Studio are moving in the same direction, placing agentic AI as an extension to enterprise ecosystems rather than stand-alone products.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe difference between the competing platforms lies in execution \u2013 some focus on workflow automation, others on conversational depth or ease of integration with other parts of the IT stack.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor technology buyers, such diversity is an opportunity and a risk. Vendors are racing to define what agentic AI means in practice, and there&#8217;s an undoubted element of agentic AI being 2025&#8217;s buzzword, implying differentiation between pure LLM models and practical tools useful in business contexts. Some vendors view agentic as an architecture \u2013 modular, distributed, and explainable, while others frame agentic AI as a layer of automation that builds itself \u2013 or rather, can discover what powers it&#8217;s been granted, and use them according to natural language instructions. The truth of agentic AI&#8217;s abilities sits somewhere between engineering promises and operational reality.\\n</p>\\n<h3>The business case \u2013 and the caveats</h3>\\n<p>\\nAgentic AI systems promise extraordinary benefits. They can accelerate routine development, coordinate multiple business functions, and use data repositories that were once siloed. For enterprises under pressure to deliver digital transformation with limited headcount, the idea of self-building AI teams is compelling.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the use of the conditional tense in many vendors&#8217; marketing materials and descriptions is telling: agentic AI <i>can</i> achieve savings, <i>could</i> drive faster operations, and so on.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBusiness leaders should approach such systems with a clear head. There are few proven case studies beyond pilot programmes inside large corporations (those with mature data governance and deep budgets), and even in those organisations, the returns have been uneven. Failures are rarely shouted from the rooftops, after all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe biggest risks are not technical \u2013 they\u2019re organisational. Delegating complex decision-making to automated agents without sufficient oversight introduces potential bias, compliance breaches, and reputational exposure. Systems can also generate automation debt: a growing tangle of interconnected bots that become difficult to monitor or update as business processes evolve.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe issue of necessary organisational change is troubling on two counts, furthermore. Most business processes have evolved a particular way for good reasons, so why change them to implement a new, largely unproven technology? Secondly, what&#8217;s often proposed is change that&#8217;s instigated by technology implementation. Shouldn&#8217;t processes change for strategic reasons, and technology support that change? Is this a case of the IT tail wagging the business dog?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSecurity remains a further concern. Each agent increases the surface area for potential breaches or data misuse, particularly when they are designed to communicate and collaborate autonomously. As more workflows become self-directed, ensuring traceability and accountability becomes essential, and more difficult to unpick as complexity increases. The necessary headcount to monitor results and ensure rigorous oversight could negate any ROI agentic AI offers.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Why agentic AI attracts enterprises</h3>\\n<p>\\nDespite the challenges, the attraction is easy to understand. A successful agentic system can transform the speed at which an enterprise experiments and scales. By delegating repeatable cognitive tasks \u2013 from compliance checks to customer service triage \u2013 organisations can redirect human activity elsewhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDruid\u2019s Virtual Authoring Teams encapsulate the logic: automate the automation. Its marketplace of domain-specific agents offers enterprises a head start, promising faster deployments and measurable ROI. For sectors struggling with talent shortages and regulatory pressure, that is an appealing prospect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoreover, Druid\u2019s emphasis on explainable AI and its orchestration layer suggests an awareness of corporate caution. Its stated pillars \u2013 control, accuracy, and results \u2013 are designed to reassure boards that transparency can coexist with speed. If the system truly delivers what the company claims, it could narrow the gap between AI experimentation and scalable transformation.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Balancing autonomy with accountability</h3>\\n<p>\\nStill, for every organisation embracing agentic AI, another remains unconvinced. Many enterprises are wary of over-promising vendors and pilot fatigue. A technology capable of designing and deploying its own successors raises operational questions. What happens when an agent acts beyond its creator\u2019s intent? How do governance frameworks keep pace?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBusiness leaders must treat autonomy as a spectrum, not a goal. The near future of enterprise AI will likely blend human-supervised automation with limited agentic autonomy. Systems like Druid\u2019s may act as orchestration hubs rather than fully independent actors.\\n</p>\\n<h3>From hype to utility</h3>\\n<p>\\nAgentic AI represents a natural evolution of automation in a wild frontier. Its potential is obvious, yet the market still lacks broad, evidence-based validation of sustained business outcomes. It may just be early days, or may be hyperbole drowning out the voices of reason.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor now, agentic systems <i>do work</i> in controlled contexts \u2013 contact-centre operations, document processing, and IT service management. Scaling agentic AI across organisations will require maturity not just in technology, but in culture, process design, and methods of oversight.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs Druid and its peers expand their offerings, enterprises will need to weigh the cost of control against the promised wins from better automation. The next two years will determine whether AI factories become a part of business operations, or another layer of abstraction with its own overheads.\\n</p>\\n<p><em>(Image source: &#8220;Black and grey wolf (female from Druid pack,&#8217;Half Black&#8217;) walking in road near Lamar River bridge&#8221; by YellowstoneNPS is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0. )</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&#038;utm_medium=Footer-banner&#038;utm_campaign=world-series\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\\"></a></p>\\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

Instead, it was anchored off the Port of Alexandria, Egypt \u2013 another known location for offloading grain from occupied Ukraine, according to OCCRP reporting.\\n\u201cGrain Theft\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine has repeatedly tried to dissuade countries from purchasing shipments loaded with what it describes as stolen grain from occupied regions.\xa0\\nThe Port of Sevastopol and the Avlita grain terminal remain under European, UK and US sanctions.

You know how it goes: you start by asking \u201cwhat if?\u201d and then you have something weird and wonderful hours later.\xa0\\nThis summer, we decided to celebrate that spirit with For the Love of Code, our first-ever competition for projects built purely for fun. More than 300 developers answered the call. Some leaned on GitHub Copilot to refactor ideas, fix bugs, and spark inspiration. Some teamed up. Others flew solo, guided only by caffeine and curiosity.\\nEntries spanned everything from a Breakout game powered by your GitHub graph, to a laugh-track that plays on every commit, a Yelp-style code reviewer in VS Code \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606, a Copilot you can literally see on camera, and even a comic strip made from your release notes.\\nWe invited participants to build anything that sparks joy across six whimsical categories:\\n\ud83d\udd18 Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights: Hardware hacks, LEDs, sensors, and gadgets galore.\\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Terminal talent: Command-line creations and retro computing love letters.\\n\ud83c\udf10 World wide wonders: Browser-based experiments, apps, and interactive art.\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents of change: AI, bots, and automation with heart.\\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Game on: Games big or small, serious or silly.\\n\ud83c\udccf Everything but the kitchen sink: The wildcard (if it doesn\u2019t fit anywhere else, it fits here).\\n\ud83d\udca1 How GitHub Copilot powered creativity\\nGitHub Copilot helped contest participants:\\nCreate efficient Go code to integrate with the GitHub API\\nScaffold repetitive code and boilerplate\\nSuggest API calls and syntax corrections\\nDebug hardware quirks and runtime errors\\nSpark inspiration for algorithms and UI design\\nWrite their first Python program\\nMake their first real push to GitHub\\nAnd it didn\u2019t stop there. When creativity met Copilot, side projects turned into something spectacular.\\nDiscover how Copilot can help you with your project >\\nMeet the winners: Open source experiments, AI side projects, and more\\nHere are the top three entries from each category.\\n\ud83d\udd18 Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights\xa0\\nPlane Tracker: DIY radar on your desk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlane Tracker by @cpstroum is a DIY radar that uses an Adafruit Circuit Playground, Bluetooth, and the ADS-B Exchange API to fetch live flight data. It turns nearby planes into a real-time mini radar display.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @cpstroum with Git itself and with structuring the initial project for their first real push to GitHub. Thanks, Copilot! And welcome aboard, @cpstroum!\\n\\n\\n\\nCadrephoto: The easy e-ink photo frame\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCadrephoto by @ozh is a Raspberry Pi and e-ink photo frame that displays pictures emailed to it (no app, no setup, perfect for less tech-savvy people). It checks an inbox, downloads the latest photo, and updates the screen automatically.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @ozh with their first Python project. It worked smoothly inside JetBrains IDEs and made code completion feel almost like magic.\\n\\n\\n\\nBuildIn: Traffic-light builds for your repository\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuildIn by @SUNSET-Sejong-University and @lepetitprince99 is a real-life traffic light for your code that sits on your desk. Using an Arduino and the GitHub API, it lights up red, yellow, green, or blue to show your repository\u2019s build status at a glance.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @SUNSET-Sejong-University debug and optimize their code. It saved time tracking down tricky hardware issues and made troubleshooting much easier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Terminal talent\\nRestoHack: A roguelike resurrected from 1984\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRestoHack by @Critlist resurrects the 1984 roguelike game that inspired NetHack, rebuilt from the original source with modern tools and a preservationist\u2019s touch. It compiles cleanly, runs faithfully, and proves that forty years later, permadeath still hits hard.\\nJukebox CLI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJukebox CLI by @FedeCarollo is a colorful, animated jukebox that runs right in your terminal. Built in Rust with Ratatui, it plays MP3s, shows floating musical notes, and color-codes each track in a scrollable playlist. You can play, pause, skip, and adjust the volume without ever leaving your command line.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @FedeCarollo explore unfamiliar Rust libraries and find their footing.\\n\\n\\n\\nTuneminal: Sing your commits from the command line\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuneminal by @heza-ru turns your terminal into a full-blown karaoke stage with scrolling lyrics, live audio visualization, and scoring that rewards your inner rock star. It\u2019s open source, cross-platform, and the perfect excuse to sing while that git clone takes a while.\\n\ud83c\udf10 World wide wonders\\nNetstalgia: Surf the \u201890s web on virtual dial-up\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetstalgia by @heza-ru (again!) is a fully functional \u201890s web fever dream built with modern tech, but visually stuck on virtual dial-up. It\u2019s got dancing babies, popup ads, a fake BBS, and more CRT glow than your old Gateway 2000 ever survived.\\nIn true retro internet spirit, it even ships with a fake GitHub Star Ransomware\u2014a tongue-in-cheek \u201cvirus\u201d that demands you star the repo to \u201cdecrypt your files.\u201d A clever (and harmless) new twist on the eternal quest for GitHub stars. \u2b50\ud83d\udcbe\\nBionic Reader: Speed read your screen\\nBionic Reader by @Awesome-XV rewires how you read by bolding the first few letters of each word so your brain fills in the rest. It\u2019s like giving your eyes a speed boost without the caffeine jitters to read faster than ever.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @Awesome-XV write project documentation and scaffold the initial codebase.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Git Roast Show: Roast your GitHub profile\u2026 lovingly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGit Roast Show by @rawrnuck and @Anmol0201 is a full-stack web app that humorously \u201croasts\u201d your GitHub profile. Built with React, Vite, and Express, it fetches live GitHub data to generate personalized, sound-enhanced, and animated comedy roasts.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @rawrnuck understand algorithms and handle the repetitive parts of their project.\\n\\n\\n\\nNightlio: a mood tracker you actually own\\nNightlio by @shirsakm is a privacy-first mood tracker and daily journal you can self-host in minutes. Log how you feel on a 5-point scale, add Markdown notes, tag entries like #Sleep or #Productivity, then explore calendars, streaks, and simple stats to spot patterns. It runs anywhere with Docker, stores data in a local SQLite file, and keeps things clean with JWT-protected APIs, a React/Vite front end, and optional Google OAuth. No ads. No subscriptions. Your server, your rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Because @heza-ru placed in two categories, we\u2019ve added a fourth winner to this category.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @shirsakm with refactors, color palette updates, and codebase-wide changes that would have taken much longer by hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents of change\\nNeosgenesis: AI that thinks about thinking\\nNeosgenesis by @answeryt is a metacognitive AI framework that teaches machines to think about how they think. It runs a five-stage loop (think, verify, learn, optimize, decide) while juggling multiple LLMs, tools, and real-time feedback. A multi-armed bandit picks the best reasoning patterns, and when it stalls, an \u201caha\u201d mode explores fresh paths.\\nMediVision Assistant: Accessible AI healthcare for all\\nMediVision Assistant by @omkardongre is an AI healthcare companion that helps elderly and disabled users manage their health through voice, image, and video. Users can scan medications, analyze skin conditions, log symptoms by voice, and chat with an AI doctor-like assistant.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped @omkardongre generate React components, API templates, and AI integration code. It handled the boilerplate so they could focus on building features and improving the experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuiviva: The r\xe9sum\xe9 that talks back\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuiviva by @katawiecz is an interactive AI-powered CV that turns a job hunt into a chat adventure. Ask about skills or projects, or type \u201cGandalf\u201d to unlock secret nerd mode. All this goes to show that even r\xe9sum\xe9s can be fun.\\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Game on\\nAI-Dventure: Infinite worlds, infinite choices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI-Dventure by @FedeCarollo is an interactive text adventure built in Rust and powered by OpenAI\u2019s models. Players explore dynamically generated worlds in fantasy, horror, sci-fi, or historical settings where every command shapes the story and no two runs are the same.\\nBeatBugging: Debug to the beat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeatBugging by @sandra-aliaga, @Joshep-c, @RyanValdivia, and @tniia turns debugging into a rhythm game that converts your system logs into musical beats. Built in Python, it lets you fix bugs to the rhythm on a 5-by-5 grid and makes debugging sound unexpectedly good.\\n\\n\\n Copilot cameo: GitHub Copilot helped the team figure out next steps when they got stuck, offering helpful hints that kept development moving.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuMind: A multiplayer battle of wits and vibes\\nMuMind by @FontesHabana is a web-based multiplayer version of the party game Herd Mentality, where players try to match the majority\u2019s answers to score points. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, it offers multilingual support, lively animations, and a smooth, responsive experience.\\n\ud83c\udccf Everything but the kitchen sink\\nGitFrag: Defrag your contributions graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@chornonoh-vova built GitFrag to reorganize your contributions graph using classic sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick, and counting sort).

They are also known for providing thorough, detailed reports that greatly assist with impact assessments and enable us to take quicker, more effective action.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\\">\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How did you get involved with Bug Bounty? What has kept you coming back to it?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I got involved with the program quite coincidentally while working on a personal project in my spare time. Given my background in (and passion for) software engineering, I&rsquo;m always curious about how systems behave, especially when it comes to handling complex edge cases. That curiosity often leads me to pick apart new features or changes I encounter to see how they hold up&mdash;something that has taken me down fascinating rabbit holes and ultimately led to some findings with great impact.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What keeps me going is the thrill of showing how seemingly minor issues can have real-world impact. Taking something small and possibly overlooked, exploring its implications, and demonstrating how it could escalate into a serious vulnerability feels very rewarding.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy doing when you aren&rsquo;t hacking?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Having recently become a father of two, much of my time outside of work revolves around being present with my family and striving to be the best version of myself for them. I also want to acknowledge that my partner&mdash;my favorite person and better half&mdash;has been incredibly supportive. Even if she has no clue what I&rsquo;m doing during my late-night sessions, she gives me uninterrupted time to work on my side projects, for which I&rsquo;m deeply grateful.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;m from Norway, and one of the many benefits of living here is the easy access to incredible nature. We try to make the most of it together through hiking, camping, and cross-country skiing. Being out in the wilderness is a perfect way to disconnect, recharge, and gain perspective away from a busy world. We find that after time outdoors, one can come back more grounded, with a clear mind and renewed focus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How do you keep up with and learn about vulnerability trends?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I stay up to date by reading write-ups from other researchers, which are an excellent way to see how others are approaching problems and what kinds of vulnerabilities are being uncovered. While this is important, one should also attempt to stay ahead of the curve, so I try to identify and dive into areas that are in need of further research.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Professionally, as a security engineer, my primary area of expertise is software supply chain security, an often-neglected but increasingly important field. I spend much of my time researching gaps and developing solutions to mitigate emerging threats. I&rsquo;m also very lucky to work closely with some of the best talent in Norway.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What tools or workflows have been game-changers for your research? Are there any lesser-known utilities you recommend?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When doing research in my spare time, I prefer to write my own tools rather than relying solely on what you get off the shelf, as I find that it gives me a deeper understanding of the problem and helps me identify new areas that could be worth exploring in the future.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>None of my personal security tooling has been published yet, but I plan to&mdash;eventually&trade;&mdash;release a toolkit to build comprehensive offline graphs of GitHub organizations with an extensible query suite to quickly uncover common misconfigurations and hidden attack paths.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What are your favorite classes of bugs to research and why?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;m particularly drawn to injection-related vulnerabilities, subtle logical flaws, and overlooked assumptions that may not seem important at first glance. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by novel techniques for bypassing even the strictest content security policies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What I enjoy most is demonstrating how seemingly benign findings can be chained together into something with significant impact. These vulnerabilities often expose weaknesses in the underlying design rather than just surface-level issues. My passion for building resilient systems naturally shapes this approach, driving me to explore how small cracks can compromise a system&rsquo;s overall integrity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve found some complex and significant bugs in your work. Can you talk a bit about your process?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most significant discoveries I have made in my spare time have been coincidental and, in most cases, a side effect of being sidetracked by my own curiosity, rather than the result of a targeted approach with a rigid methodology.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always had an insatiable curiosity and fascination with how systems work under the hood, and I let that curiosity guide my process outside of work. When I notice something unusual, I dig deeper, peeling back the layers until I fully understand what&rsquo;s happening. From there&mdash;if it&rsquo;s worthwhile&mdash;I carefully document each step to map out potential attack paths and piece together a clear, comprehensive picture of the vulnerability, which enables me to build a strong foundation for further analysis and reporting.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Do you have any advice or recommended resources for researchers looking to get involved with Bug Bounty?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Don&rsquo;t settle for a simple finding. Dig deeper and explore its implications. When you have a grasp of the bigger picture, seemingly benign issues could turn out to have substantial impact.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Do you have any social media platforms you&rsquo;d like to share with our readers?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Currently I have a <a href=\\"https://pages.dev.bio/\\">page</a>, where I&rsquo;ll be posting interesting content in the near future.

They are also known for providing thorough, detailed reports that greatly assist with impact assessments and enable us to take quicker, more effective action.\\nHow did you get involved with Bug Bounty? What has kept you coming back to it?\\nI got involved with the program quite coincidentally while working on a personal project in my spare time. Given my background in (and passion for) software engineering, I\u2019m always curious about how systems behave, especially when it comes to handling complex edge cases. That curiosity often leads me to pick apart new features or changes I encounter to see how they hold up\u2014something that has taken me down fascinating rabbit holes and ultimately led to some findings with great impact.\\nWhat keeps me going is the thrill of showing how seemingly minor issues can have real-world impact. Taking something small and possibly overlooked, exploring its implications, and demonstrating how it could escalate into a serious vulnerability feels very rewarding.\\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you aren\u2019t hacking?\\nHaving recently become a father of two, much of my time outside of work revolves around being present with my family and striving to be the best version of myself for them. I also want to acknowledge that my partner\u2014my favorite person and better half\u2014has been incredibly supportive. Even if she has no clue what I\u2019m doing during my late-night sessions, she gives me uninterrupted time to work on my side projects, for which I\u2019m deeply grateful.\\nI\u2019m from Norway, and one of the many benefits of living here is the easy access to incredible nature. We try to make the most of it together through hiking, camping, and cross-country skiing. Being out in the wilderness is a perfect way to disconnect, recharge, and gain perspective away from a busy world. We find that after time outdoors, one can come back more grounded, with a clear mind and renewed focus.\\nHow do you keep up with and learn about vulnerability trends?\\nI stay up to date by reading write-ups from other researchers, which are an excellent way to see how others are approaching problems and what kinds of vulnerabilities are being uncovered. While this is important, one should also attempt to stay ahead of the curve, so I try to identify and dive into areas that are in need of further research.\\nProfessionally, as a security engineer, my primary area of expertise is software supply chain security, an often-neglected but increasingly important field. I spend much of my time researching gaps and developing solutions to mitigate emerging threats. I\u2019m also very lucky to work closely with some of the best talent in Norway.\\nWhat tools or workflows have been game-changers for your research? Are there any lesser-known utilities you recommend?\\nWhen doing research in my spare time, I prefer to write my own tools rather than relying solely on what you get off the shelf, as I find that it gives me a deeper understanding of the problem and helps me identify new areas that could be worth exploring in the future.\\nNone of my personal security tooling has been published yet, but I plan to\u2014eventually\u2122\u2014release a toolkit to build comprehensive offline graphs of GitHub organizations with an extensible query suite to quickly uncover common misconfigurations and hidden attack paths.\\nWhat are your favorite classes of bugs to research and why?\\nI\u2019m particularly drawn to injection-related vulnerabilities, subtle logical flaws, and overlooked assumptions that may not seem important at first glance. Recently, I\u2019ve been intrigued by novel techniques for bypassing even the strictest content security policies.\\nWhat I enjoy most is demonstrating how seemingly benign findings can be chained together into something with significant impact. These vulnerabilities often expose weaknesses in the underlying design rather than just surface-level issues. My passion for building resilient systems naturally shapes this approach, driving me to explore how small cracks can compromise a system\u2019s overall integrity.\\nYou\u2019ve found some complex and significant bugs in your work. Can you talk a bit about your process?\\nThe most significant discoveries I have made in my spare time have been coincidental and, in most cases, a side effect of being sidetracked by my own curiosity, rather than the result of a targeted approach with a rigid methodology.\\nI\u2019ve always had an insatiable curiosity and fascination with how systems work under the hood, and I let that curiosity guide my process outside of work. When I notice something unusual, I dig deeper, peeling back the layers until I fully understand what\u2019s happening. From there\u2014if it\u2019s worthwhile\u2014I carefully document each step to map out potential attack paths and piece together a clear, comprehensive picture of the vulnerability, which enables me to build a strong foundation for further analysis and reporting.\\nDo you have any advice or recommended resources for researchers looking to get involved with Bug Bounty?\\nDon\u2019t settle for a simple finding. Dig deeper and explore its implications. When you have a grasp of the bigger picture, seemingly benign issues could turn out to have substantial impact.\\nDo you have any social media platforms you\u2019d like to share with our readers?\\nCurrently I have a page, where I\u2019ll be posting interesting content in the near future. I\u2019m also on LinkedIn.\\nThank you, @dev-bio, for participating in GitHub\u2019s bug bounty researcher spotlight!

He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak. Source: intelx.io. Below: Facebook data leak in Bellingcat\u2019s database.\\nPeople using Numbuster and GetContact, meanwhile, tagged the same phone number as belonging to Milchakov.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth screenshots depict Numbuster results for Milchakov\u2019s phone number ending in 386. Tags include his famous nickname \u201cSerb\u201d, but also \u201cAlexey Yuryevich\u201d (his name and patronymic) and \u201cSerb Milchakov Alexey\u201d.\\nContact book apps like these harvest data from users\u2019 phones and have been used in many investigations, such as Bellingcat\u2019s Berlin Tiergarten assassination investigation (where Numbuster and GetContact were used) and the investigation into the death of Colombian protestor, Lucas Villa (where TrueCaller was used).\\nIn Numbuster, one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers (ending in 663 and that he used for his Yandex Food account) is tagged as \u201cVlad United Russia St. Petersburg Youth Politics\u201d.\\n\\nThe first two entries list Romanov\u2019s name as Vladislav Gillung.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day.

Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.
