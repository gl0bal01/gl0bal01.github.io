GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining.

We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.</b></p>\\n<p>Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the &#8220;OODA loop,&#8221; for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it&#8217;s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic&#8217;s definition: &#8220;Agents are models using tools in a loop.&#8221;<sup><a id=\\"ref1back\\" href=\\"#ref1\\">1</a></sup></p>\\n<h3>OODA Loops for Agentic AI</h3>\\n<p>Traditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don&#8217;t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation</a>), can ingest poisoned documents. Tool-calling application programming interfaces can execute untrusted code. Modern AI sensors can encompass the entire Internet; their environments are inherently adversarial. That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.</p>\\n<p>In 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: &#8220;prompt injection.&#8221;<sup><a id=\\"ref2back\\" href=\\"#ref2\\">2</a></sup> Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison&#8217;s insight was that this isn&#8217;t just a filtering problem; it&#8217;s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful&#8212;treating all inputs uniformly&#8212;is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Insecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.</li>\\n<li>AI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model&#8217;s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren&#8217;t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>AI increasingly maintains state&#8212;in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.</li>\\n<li>Agents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can&#8217;t verify tool semantics, only syntax. &#8220;Submit SQL query&#8221; might mean &#8220;exfiltrate database&#8221; because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>For example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>Observe:</em> The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity.</li>\\n<li><em>Orient:</em> The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model&#8217;s worldview&#8212;its orientation&#8212;can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases.</li>\\n<li><em>Decide:</em> The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment. The decision process itself becomes the payload. Models can be manipulated to trust malicious sources preferentially.</li>\\n<li><em>Act:</em> The risks include output manipulation, tool confusion, and action hijacking. MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>AI gives the old phrase &#8220;inside your adversary&#8217;s OODA loop&#8221; new meaning. For Boyd&#8217;s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren&#8217;t just metaphorically inside; they&#8217;re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that&#8217;s where the data are. AI&#8217;s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.</p>\\n<p>Worse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.</p>\\n<h3>The Source of the Problem</h3>\\n<p>The fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don&#8217;t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.</p>\\n<p>Prompt injection might be unsolvable in today&#8217;s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won&#8217;t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.</p>\\n<p>This is Ken Thompson&#8217;s &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack all over again.<sup><a id=\\"ref3back\\" href=\\"#ref3\\">3</a></sup> Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can&#8217;t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.</p>\\n<p>This is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart&#8212;you can&#8217;t verify your inputs. Smart and secure&#8212;you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can&#8217;t be used for this. Secure and fast&#8212;you&#8217;re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.</p>\\n<p>This trilemma isn&#8217;t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry&#8212;when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model&#8217;s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.</p>\\n<p>Prompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can&#8217;t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can&#8217;t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can&#8217;t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can&#8217;t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.</p>\\n<p>In security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone\u2019s AI OODA loop uses the system&#8217;s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn&#8217;t a defect&#8212;it&#8217;s the feature working correctly.</p>\\n<h3>Where to Go Next?</h3>\\n<p>The shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more&#8212;and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?</p>\\n<p>Physical constraints protected Boyd&#8217;s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn&#8217;t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?</p>\\n<p>Computer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.<sup><a id=\\"ref4back\\" href=\\"#ref4\\">4</a></sup></p>\\n<p>Trustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can&#8217;t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn&#8217;t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.</p>\\n<p>AI OODA loops and integrity aren&#8217;t fundamentally opposed, but today&#8217;s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn&#8217;t inside the loop by accident; it&#8217;s there by architecture.

We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.\\nMany decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the \u201cOODA loop,\u201d for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it\u2019s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic\u2019s definition: \u201cAgents are models using tools in a loop.\u201d1\\nOODA Loops for Agentic AI\\nTraditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don\u2019t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation), can ingest poisoned documents. Tool-calling application programming interfaces can execute untrusted code. Modern AI sensors can encompass the entire Internet; their environments are inherently adversarial. That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.\\nIn 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: \u201cprompt injection.\u201d2 Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison\u2019s insight was that this isn\u2019t just a filtering problem; it\u2019s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful\u2014treating all inputs uniformly\u2014is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.\\nInsecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.\\nAI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model\u2019s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren\u2019t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.\\nAI increasingly maintains state\u2014in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.\\nAgents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can\u2019t verify tool semantics, only syntax. \u201cSubmit SQL query\u201d might mean \u201cexfiltrate database\u201d because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.\\nFor example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom.\\nObserve: The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity.\\nOrient: The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model\u2019s worldview\u2014its orientation\u2014can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases.\\nDecide: The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment. The decision process itself becomes the payload. Models can be manipulated to trust malicious sources preferentially.\\nAct: The risks include output manipulation, tool confusion, and action hijacking. MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.\\nAI gives the old phrase \u201cinside your adversary\u2019s OODA loop\u201d new meaning. For Boyd\u2019s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren\u2019t just metaphorically inside; they\u2019re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that\u2019s where the data are. AI\u2019s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.\\nWorse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.\\nThe Source of the Problem\\nThe fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don\u2019t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.\\nPrompt injection might be unsolvable in today\u2019s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won\u2019t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.\\nThis is Ken Thompson\u2019s \u201ctrusting trust\u201d attack all over again.3 Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can\u2019t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.\\nThis is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart\u2014you can\u2019t verify your inputs. Smart and secure\u2014you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can\u2019t be used for this. Secure and fast\u2014you\u2019re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.\\nThis trilemma isn\u2019t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry\u2014when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model\u2019s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.\\nPrompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can\u2019t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can\u2019t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can\u2019t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can\u2019t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.\\nIn security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone\u2019s AI OODA loop uses the system\u2019s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn\u2019t a defect\u2014it\u2019s the feature working correctly.\\nWhere to Go Next?\\nThe shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more\u2014and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?\\nPhysical constraints protected Boyd\u2019s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn\u2019t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?\\nComputer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.4\\nTrustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can\u2019t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn\u2019t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.\\nAI OODA loops and integrity aren\u2019t fundamentally opposed, but today\u2019s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn\u2019t inside the loop by accident; it\u2019s there by architecture. Web-scale AI means web-scale integrity failure. Every capability corrupts.\\nIntegrity isn\u2019t a feature you add; it\u2019s an architecture you choose. So far, we have built AI systems where \u201cfast\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d preclude \u201csecure.\u201d We optimized for capability over verification, for accessing web-scale data over ensuring trust. AI agents will be even more powerful\u2014and increasingly autonomous. And without integrity, they will also be dangerous.\\nReferences\\n1. S. Willison, Simon Willison\u2019s Weblog, May 22, 2025.

It\u2019s reach into our data extends just as far. \\nAfter investigating how much data Facebook had collected about him in his nearly 20 years with the platform, Lock and Code host David Ruiz had similar questions about the other Big Tech platforms in his life, and this time, he turned his attention to Google. \\nGoogle dominates much of the modern web. It has a search engine that handles billions of requests a day. Its tracking and metrics service, Google Analytics, is embedded into reportedly 10s of millions of websites. Its Maps feature not only serves up directions around the world, it also tracks traffic patterns across countless streets, highways, and more. Its online services for email (Gmail), cloud storage (Google Drive), and office software (Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides) are household names. And it also runs the most popular web browser in the world, Google Chrome, and the most popular operating system in the world, Android. \\nToday, on the Lock and Code podcast, Ruiz explains how he requested his data from Google and what he learned not only about the company, but about himself, in the process.

The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left).

Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann. Top left: The Overlander Airport, where he allegedly met an aircraft on Dec 27, 2024. Bottom left: cocaine seized by the AFP. Right: Herrmann after he was detained. Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\nVideo footage of the assault taken by The LA Ten Four shows the man being punched, kicked and stomped on by several others. At least two of the attackers appear to be wearing SoCal Active Club t-shirts, identifiable as such by photos and videos posted from the vigil.\\n\\nA frame from video footage filmed by LA Ten Four of the assault, showing one of several men wearing shirts with SoCal Active Club\u2019s logo; the individual second from right of the photo in the SoCal Active Club t-shirt can be seen in the video kicking the man on the ground. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\n\\nFrames from a video posted by Patriot Front, and shared by the main Active Club Telegram channel, showing several individuals wearing the same SoCal Active Club t-shirts at the same event before the alleged assault.\\nSoCal Active Club has not responded to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment on their apparent involvement in this assault as of publication.\\nWiley D.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/globalsumudflotilla/p/DOXEm8viAZO/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">official statement</a> said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/DGGN1956/posts/812698534423606?ref=embed_post\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">National Guard on Facebook</a> stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZqrkLCnSl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">video</a> showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXaR_MiOZ_/?igsh=YjdnaTEybGNocW94\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">recorded</a> from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast &#8211; the highest point on the vessel &#8211; before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"551\\" height=\\"987\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Gaza-flotilla-higher-colour-reduction-gif.gif\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49793\\"/></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Screencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat.

Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right).

They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions. For example, the Ukraine-Russia war has led to many videos of drones with attached thermite or other incendiary munitions burning as they fly over enemy positions.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour&#8217;s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Published in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods.

While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by &#8216;somatic&#8217; variants acquired after birth rather than inherited &#8216;germline&#8217; variants from parents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Somatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Identifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-deepsomatic-works\\">How DeepSomatic works</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren&#8217;t inherited. These variations reveal what&#8217;s fuelling the tumour&#8217;s growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual&#8217;s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic can also work in &#8216;tumour-only&#8217; mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-training-a-more-precise-ai-cancer-research-tool\\">Training a more precise AI cancer research tool</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Training an accurate AI model requires high-quality data.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour\u2019s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.\\nPublished in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.\\nThe challenge of somatic variants\\nCancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by \u2018somatic\u2019 variants acquired after birth rather than inherited \u2018germline\u2019 variants from parents.\\nSomatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.\\nIdentifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.\\nHow DeepSomatic works\\nIn clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren\u2019t inherited. These variations reveal what\u2019s fuelling the tumour\u2019s growth.\\nThe model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual\u2019s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.\\nDeepSomatic can also work in \u2018tumour-only\u2019 mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.\\nTraining a more precise AI cancer research tool\\nTraining an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.\\nThese samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-echoes-of-the-dot-com-era\\">Echoes of the dot-com era</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Despite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Speaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-role-of-governments-and-global-policy\\">The role of governments and global policy</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Public policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As <em><a href=\\"https://hbr.org/2025/10/is-ai-a-boom-or-a-bubble\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Harvard Business Review</a></em> pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>China has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-market-warnings-over-a-possible-ai-bubble\\">Market warnings over a possible AI bubble</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.\\nEchoes of the dot-com era\\nDespite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.\\nSpeaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.\\nDawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.\\nThe role of governments and global policy\\nPublic policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As Harvard Business Review pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.\\nChina has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.\\nMeanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.\\nFor businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.\\nMarket warnings over a possible AI bubble\\nThe Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.\\nThis concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.\\nBuilding long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears\\nWhen asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.\\nRather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn\u2019t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what\u2019s coming.\\nMiceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,\u201d he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.\\nDifferent shades of caution\\nAcross the industry, opinions vary on whether AI\u2019s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.\\nAccording to Reuters, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore\u2019s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding \u201chuge multiples\u201d despite modest revenues.

it&rsquo;s my fault.&rsquo;</strong></p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier, Log4j maintainer</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is the untold story of how one maintainer and the <a href=\\"https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2\\">Log4j</a> team navigated a crisis that exposed critical gaps in our digital infrastructure and demonstrated the importance of open source security and sustainability. Now, initiatives like the <a href=\\"https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a> are working to make sure it never happens again.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It all started a few hours earlier on a cold November day, when Christian, who is a maintainer of the open source project Log4j, planned to spend time playing games with his son. Instead, he found himself staring at his phone, watching notifications pile up in his inbox&mdash;10, then 20 emails flooding in. When he saw the words &ldquo;remote code execution,&rdquo; his first thought was: &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m on the wrong mailing list.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t. And within hours, Christian would be at the center of what became known as Log4Shell: the most severe vulnerability in internet history, affecting billions of devices from Fortune 500 companies to Minecraft servers worldwide.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;I told my son, I will play with you in like five minutes,&rdquo; Christian recalls. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t see me for the next couple of days.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Watch the full interview with Christian Grobmeier and Gregg Cochran, staff program manager at GitHub, above. &#128070;</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-ubiquity-that-made-log4shell-a-perfect-storm\\">The ubiquity that made Log4Shell a perfect storm</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Log4j is foundational software. This 20+ year-old Java logging library quietly powers system events in applications worldwide, like user logins and calculation results. But this small piece of software had quietly become a dependency in thousands of projects across the Java ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Log4j is such a small, tiny library. But everybody can use it in their software.</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That ubiquity made Log4Shell devastating. Financial services companies relied on it for compliance auditing. E-commerce systems used it to track security incidents. Insurance companies needed it to monitor their software behavior. In a 2022 Tidelift survey, 49% of open source developers reported that their organization relies on Java&mdash;and most of them were using Log4j without even knowing it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Christian realized the scope of the vulnerability, the weight hit him immediately: &ldquo;Literally all Java applications in the world could be affected. Even 10% would be a major problem. This would be catastrophic.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-a-vulnerability-that-scored-a-perfect-10\\">A vulnerability that scored a perfect 10</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Log4Shell reveals how a seemingly innocent feature became an attack vector. Log4j used <a href=\\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19747-01/819-0076/jndi.html\\">Java&rsquo;s Naming and Directory Interface</a> (JNDI) to provide flexibility, allowing developers to load software components from remote servers. But the library didn&rsquo;t validate whether JNDI lookup strings were coming from trusted sources.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;How can a string break the internet?&rdquo; Christian asks.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The exploitation was frighteningly simple. An attacker could input a malicious JNDI string into any application field that gets logged&mdash;a username field, a search box, even a Minecraft chat message&mdash;and execute remote code on the target system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\\"wp-block-code language-plaintext\\"><code>jndi:&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;server-name&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path-to-object&gt;</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even need to have special knowledge,&rdquo; Christian notes. &ldquo;You just run around and push the string wherever you want it.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\"purple-text text-gradient-purple-coral\\" style=\\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\\"><strong>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) gave Log4Shell a perfect 10: the highest possible score.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\"purple-text text-gradient-purple-coral\\" style=\\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\\">&ldquo;The first time I heard about this score, I thought, maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; Christian remembers. &ldquo;And then after a couple of days, I thought, yeah, <strong>maybe we should extend this to a score of 15 or 20.</strong>&ldquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"the-human-cost-of-maintaining-critical-infrastructure\\">The human cost of maintaining critical infrastructure</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The personal toll on maintainers during the Log4Shell crisis reveals the hidden human cost of our software supply chain. Christian and his team, mostly volunteers, suddenly found themselves responsible for patching a vulnerability affecting half the internet. The pressure was immense and deeply personal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Some of us stopped sleeping. We all felt that either we fix it right now in the next few days, or we close this project.</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fixing the initial vulnerability led to the discovery of additional issues, creating what Christian describes as &ldquo;a bag of water with a hole. When you patch the hole, you see another one.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, the community response was mixed. &ldquo;On the one hand, you have people who really hate you, and on the other hand, you have people who are really behind you,&rdquo; Christian explains.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps most telling:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Nobody stops in to check on you. They check on the project. There&rsquo;s also nobody standing up and saying, &lsquo;hey, thank you for the good work you&rsquo;re doing to remediate this issue.&rsquo;</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"how-the-github-secure-open-source-fund-is-strengthening-security\\">How the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund is strengthening security</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Log4Shell incident highlighted a critical gap in open source security: Maintainers often lack the training and resources to build security into their projects from the ground up. This realization sparked initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund, which provides both funding and security training to critical open source projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The fund has been effective and efficient as a form of proactive protection, pooled resources, and shared responsibility. Think of it as &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; for the open source supply chain&mdash;helping make the digital ecosystem safer and reducing risks that could impact billions of users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Christian participated in the <a href=\\"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a> security training program, and the impact was transformative.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The training didn&rsquo;t just provide technical knowledge&mdash;it shifted his perspective. Christian explains, &ldquo;With this training, developers are no longer the weakest link. Instead, they&rsquo;re the first line of defense.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This change in mindset is crucial. As Christian puts it:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Ignorance is by far the worst and most critical security hole. It will basically break all software.</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked if the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund training could have prevented Log4Shell, Christian is direct: &ldquo;If this training had existed five years ago, maybe Log4Shell wouldn&rsquo;t be here today.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"technical-lessons-building-security-by-default\\">Technical lessons: Building security by default</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Log4Shell incident taught the industry several critical lessons about secure development practices:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>1. Validate all external input</strong>: Never trust data that crosses trust boundaries, especially in foundational libraries that process user input.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Disable dangerous features by default</strong>: Log4j now ships with JNDI lookups disabled by default.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Implement defense in depth</strong>: Modern applications need multiple layers of protection, from input validation to runtime protections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Automate security scanning</strong>: Tools like GitHub&rsquo;s code scanning and Dependabot can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>5. Maintain a software bills of materials (SBOMs)</strong>: When Log4Shell hit, many organizations couldn&rsquo;t determine if they were affected because they didn&rsquo;t know their dependencies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;I got phone calls from colleagues, asking me: &lsquo;Am I really affected?&rsquo; SBOMs give you a technical way to find out what dependencies you&rsquo;re using in a project,&rdquo; Christian explains.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"industry-wide-lessons-for-sustainable-open-source\\">Industry-wide lessons for sustainable open source</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the technical lessons from Log4Shell are crucial, technology changes aren&rsquo;t enough. The deeper challenge lies in how we support the humans who maintain the open source infrastructure our world depends on. This crisis exposed several systemic issues in how we approach open source sustainability and security:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Community is crucial</strong>: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re maintaining open source software, just as one single person, that&rsquo;s a risk,&rdquo; Christian emphasizes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Security training needs to be accessible</strong>: Traditional security education often doesn&rsquo;t reach the maintainers who need it most.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Funding alone isn&rsquo;t enough</strong>: While financial support helps, Christian found that training and community were equally important. When offered funding to pay team members, many declined due to tax implications or existing jobs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Kindness matters</strong>: &ldquo;Behind every small open source library, there&rsquo;s a human writing the code,&rdquo; Christian reminds us. &ldquo;If you find something that&rsquo;s not right, help out instead of being angry.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Security can be improved for every project</strong>: During the program, Christian implemented multiple new security improvements, including hardening GitHub Actions against script injections, developing a new threat model, and collaborating with ScanCode to identify hidden Log4j artifacts in third-party code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"your-role-in-securing-the-software-supply-chain\\">Your role in securing the software supply chain</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Log4Shell story isn&rsquo;t just about one vulnerability; it&rsquo;s about the collective responsibility we all share in maintaining the open source ecosystem that powers the modern internet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>For maintainers</strong>: Apply to programs like the <a href=\\"https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a>. <a href=\\"http://gh.io/protect-your-project\\">Enable built-in security tools</a> like GitHub&rsquo;s <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning\\">code scanning</a> and <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide\\">Dependabot</a>. <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository\\">Export SBOMs</a> to help downstream users understand their dependencies, and <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories\\">publish security advisories</a> for all vulnerabilities found in your project.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>For enterprises: </strong>Become a Funding or Ecosystem Partner of the <a href=\\"https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund.</a> Invest engineering time in the upstream projects you depend on. Don&rsquo;t just consume open source&mdash;contribute with code, documentation, security reviews, and funding.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>For individual developers</strong>: Select carefully the new dependencies that you pull in, for example by <a href=\\"https://scorecard.dev/\\">checking their security posture</a>. Consider the data you process may be attacker controlled and strictly validate untrusted inputs to prevent unintended behavior. Contribute test cases and documentation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"the-path-forward\\">The path forward</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Today, <a href=\\"https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2\\">Log4j</a> has an 8.3 OpenSSF score, which demonstrates good security practices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the broader lesson extends beyond any single project. As Christian puts it:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Learning is the only cure for ignorance.

Now, initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund are working to make sure it never happens again.\\nIt all started a few hours earlier on a cold November day, when Christian, who is a maintainer of the open source project Log4j, planned to spend time playing games with his son. Instead, he found himself staring at his phone, watching notifications pile up in his inbox\u201410, then 20 emails flooding in. When he saw the words \u201cremote code execution,\u201d his first thought was: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m on the wrong mailing list.\u201d\\nHe wasn\u2019t. And within hours, Christian would be at the center of what became known as Log4Shell: the most severe vulnerability in internet history, affecting billions of devices from Fortune 500 companies to Minecraft servers worldwide.\\n\u201cI told my son, I will play with you in like five minutes,\u201d Christian recalls. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t see me for the next couple of days.\u201d\\n\\nWatch the full interview with Christian Grobmeier and Gregg Cochran, staff program manager at GitHub, above. \ud83d\udc46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ubiquity that made Log4Shell a perfect storm\\nLog4j is foundational software. This 20+ year-old Java logging library quietly powers system events in applications worldwide, like user logins and calculation results. But this small piece of software had quietly become a dependency in thousands of projects across the Java ecosystem.\\nLog4j is such a small, tiny library. But everybody can use it in their software.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nThat ubiquity made Log4Shell devastating. Financial services companies relied on it for compliance auditing. E-commerce systems used it to track security incidents. Insurance companies needed it to monitor their software behavior. In a 2022 Tidelift survey, 49% of open source developers reported that their organization relies on Java\u2014and most of them were using Log4j without even knowing it.\\nWhen Christian realized the scope of the vulnerability, the weight hit him immediately: \u201cLiterally all Java applications in the world could be affected. Even 10% would be a major problem. This would be catastrophic.\u201d\\nA vulnerability that scored a perfect 10\\nLog4Shell reveals how a seemingly innocent feature became an attack vector. Log4j used Java\u2019s Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to provide flexibility, allowing developers to load software components from remote servers. But the library didn\u2019t validate whether JNDI lookup strings were coming from trusted sources.\\n\u201cHow can a string break the internet?\u201d Christian asks.\xa0\\nThe exploitation was frighteningly simple. An attacker could input a malicious JNDI string into any application field that gets logged\u2014a username field, a search box, even a Minecraft chat message\u2014and execute remote code on the target system.\\njndi:<protocol>://<server-name>:<port>/<path-to-object>\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have special knowledge,\u201d Christian notes. \u201cYou just run around and push the string wherever you want it.\u201d\\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) gave Log4Shell a perfect 10: the highest possible score.\\n\u201cThe first time I heard about this score, I thought, maybe it\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Christian remembers. \u201cAnd then after a couple of days, I thought, yeah, maybe we should extend this to a score of 15 or 20.\u201c\\nThe human cost of maintaining critical infrastructure\\nThe personal toll on maintainers during the Log4Shell crisis reveals the hidden human cost of our software supply chain. Christian and his team, mostly volunteers, suddenly found themselves responsible for patching a vulnerability affecting half the internet. The pressure was immense and deeply personal.\\nSome of us stopped sleeping. We all felt that either we fix it right now in the next few days, or we close this project.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nFixing the initial vulnerability led to the discovery of additional issues, creating what Christian describes as \u201ca bag of water with a hole. When you patch the hole, you see another one.\u201d\\nMeanwhile, the community response was mixed. \u201cOn the one hand, you have people who really hate you, and on the other hand, you have people who are really behind you,\u201d Christian explains.\xa0\\nPerhaps most telling:\\nNobody stops in to check on you. They check on the project. There\u2019s also nobody standing up and saying, \u2018hey, thank you for the good work you\u2019re doing to remediate this issue.\u2019\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nHow the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund is strengthening security\\nThe Log4Shell incident highlighted a critical gap in open source security: Maintainers often lack the training and resources to build security into their projects from the ground up. This realization sparked initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund, which provides both funding and security training to critical open source projects.\\nThe fund has been effective and efficient as a form of proactive protection, pooled resources, and shared responsibility. Think of it as \u201cinsurance\u201d for the open source supply chain\u2014helping make the digital ecosystem safer and reducing risks that could impact billions of users.\\nChristian participated in the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund security training program, and the impact was transformative.\\nThe training didn\u2019t just provide technical knowledge\u2014it shifted his perspective. Christian explains, \u201cWith this training, developers are no longer the weakest link. Instead, they\u2019re the first line of defense.\u201d\\nThis change in mindset is crucial. As Christian puts it:\\nIgnorance is by far the worst and most critical security hole. It will basically break all software.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nWhen asked if the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund training could have prevented Log4Shell, Christian is direct: \u201cIf this training had existed five years ago, maybe Log4Shell wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\\nTechnical lessons: Building security by default\\nThe Log4Shell incident taught the industry several critical lessons about secure development practices:\\n1. Validate all external input: Never trust data that crosses trust boundaries, especially in foundational libraries that process user input.\\n2. Disable dangerous features by default: Log4j now ships with JNDI lookups disabled by default.\xa0\\n3. Implement defense in depth: Modern applications need multiple layers of protection, from input validation to runtime protections.\\n4. Automate security scanning: Tools like GitHub\u2019s code scanning and Dependabot can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.\\n5. Maintain a software bills of materials (SBOMs): When Log4Shell hit, many organizations couldn\u2019t determine if they were affected because they didn\u2019t know their dependencies.\\n\u201cI got phone calls from colleagues, asking me: \u2018Am I really affected?\u2019 SBOMs give you a technical way to find out what dependencies you\u2019re using in a project,\u201d Christian explains.\xa0\\nIndustry-wide lessons for sustainable open source\\nWhile the technical lessons from Log4Shell are crucial, technology changes aren\u2019t enough. The deeper challenge lies in how we support the humans who maintain the open source infrastructure our world depends on. This crisis exposed several systemic issues in how we approach open source sustainability and security:\\nCommunity is crucial: \u201cIf you\u2019re maintaining open source software, just as one single person, that\u2019s a risk,\u201d Christian emphasizes.\\nSecurity training needs to be accessible: Traditional security education often doesn\u2019t reach the maintainers who need it most.\\nFunding alone isn\u2019t enough: While financial support helps, Christian found that training and community were equally important. When offered funding to pay team members, many declined due to tax implications or existing jobs.\\nKindness matters: \u201cBehind every small open source library, there\u2019s a human writing the code,\u201d Christian reminds us. \u201cIf you find something that\u2019s not right, help out instead of being angry.\u201d\\nSecurity can be improved for every project: During the program, Christian implemented multiple new security improvements, including hardening GitHub Actions against script injections, developing a new threat model, and collaborating with ScanCode to identify hidden Log4j artifacts in third-party code.\\nYour role in securing the software supply chain\\nThe Log4Shell story isn\u2019t just about one vulnerability; it\u2019s about the collective responsibility we all share in maintaining the open source ecosystem that powers the modern internet.\\nFor maintainers: Apply to programs like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Enable built-in security tools like GitHub\u2019s code scanning and Dependabot. Export SBOMs to help downstream users understand their dependencies, and publish security advisories for all vulnerabilities found in your project.\\nFor enterprises: Become a Funding or Ecosystem Partner of the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Invest engineering time in the upstream projects you depend on. Don\u2019t just consume open source\u2014contribute with code, documentation, security reviews, and funding.\\nFor individual developers: Select carefully the new dependencies that you pull in, for example by checking their security posture. Consider the data you process may be attacker controlled and strictly validate untrusted inputs to prevent unintended behavior. Contribute test cases and documentation.\\nThe path forward\\nToday, Log4j has an 8.3 OpenSSF score, which demonstrates good security practices.\\nBut the broader lesson extends beyond any single project. As Christian puts it:\\nLearning is the only cure for ignorance. So just keep learning.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nThe Log4Shell incident showed us how quickly our digital world can be threatened by a single vulnerability. But it also demonstrated the power of the open source community to respond, adapt, and improve. The question isn\u2019t whether the next critical vulnerability will emerge\u2014it\u2019s whether we\u2019ll be ready for it.\\nReady to strengthen your open source project\u2019s security?

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great.

Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest.

To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.</b></p>\\n<p>Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the &#8220;OODA loop,&#8221; for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it&#8217;s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic&#8217;s definition: &#8220;Agents are models using tools in a loop.&#8221;<sup><a id=\\"ref1back\\" href=\\"#ref1\\">1</a></sup></p>\\n<h3>OODA Loops for Agentic AI</h3>\\n<p>Traditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don&#8217;t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation</a>), can ingest poisoned documents. Tool-calling application programming interfaces can execute untrusted code. Modern AI sensors can encompass the entire Internet; their environments are inherently adversarial. That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.</p>\\n<p>In 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: &#8220;prompt injection.&#8221;<sup><a id=\\"ref2back\\" href=\\"#ref2\\">2</a></sup> Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison&#8217;s insight was that this isn&#8217;t just a filtering problem; it&#8217;s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful&#8212;treating all inputs uniformly&#8212;is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Insecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.</li>\\n<li>AI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model&#8217;s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren&#8217;t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>AI increasingly maintains state&#8212;in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.</li>\\n<li>Agents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can&#8217;t verify tool semantics, only syntax. &#8220;Submit SQL query&#8221; might mean &#8220;exfiltrate database&#8221; because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>For example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>Observe:</em> The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity.</li>\\n<li><em>Orient:</em> The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model&#8217;s worldview&#8212;its orientation&#8212;can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases.</li>\\n<li><em>Decide:</em> The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment.

MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>AI gives the old phrase &#8220;inside your adversary&#8217;s OODA loop&#8221; new meaning. For Boyd&#8217;s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren&#8217;t just metaphorically inside; they&#8217;re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that&#8217;s where the data are. AI&#8217;s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.</p>\\n<p>Worse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.</p>\\n<h3>The Source of the Problem</h3>\\n<p>The fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don&#8217;t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.</p>\\n<p>Prompt injection might be unsolvable in today&#8217;s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won&#8217;t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.</p>\\n<p>This is Ken Thompson&#8217;s &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack all over again.<sup><a id=\\"ref3back\\" href=\\"#ref3\\">3</a></sup> Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can&#8217;t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.</p>\\n<p>This is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart&#8212;you can&#8217;t verify your inputs. Smart and secure&#8212;you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can&#8217;t be used for this. Secure and fast&#8212;you&#8217;re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.</p>\\n<p>This trilemma isn&#8217;t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry&#8212;when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model&#8217;s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.</p>\\n<p>Prompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can&#8217;t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can&#8217;t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can&#8217;t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can&#8217;t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.</p>\\n<p>In security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone\u2019s AI OODA loop uses the system&#8217;s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn&#8217;t a defect&#8212;it&#8217;s the feature working correctly.</p>\\n<h3>Where to Go Next?</h3>\\n<p>The shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more&#8212;and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?</p>\\n<p>Physical constraints protected Boyd&#8217;s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn&#8217;t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?</p>\\n<p>Computer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.<sup><a id=\\"ref4back\\" href=\\"#ref4\\">4</a></sup></p>\\n<p>Trustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can&#8217;t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn&#8217;t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.</p>\\n<p>AI OODA loops and integrity aren&#8217;t fundamentally opposed, but today&#8217;s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn&#8217;t inside the loop by accident; it&#8217;s there by architecture. Web-scale AI means web-scale integrity failure. Every capability corrupts.</p>\\n<p style=\\"padding-top: 1em;\\">Integrity isn&#8217;t a feature you add; it&#8217;s an architecture you choose. So far, we have built AI systems where &#8220;fast&#8221; and &#8220;smart&#8221; preclude &#8220;secure.&#8221; We optimized for capability over verification, for accessing web-scale data over ensuring trust. AI agents will be even more powerful&#8212;and increasingly autonomous. And without integrity, they will also be dangerous.</p>\\n<h4>References</h4>\\n<p><a id=\\"ref1\\" href=\\"#ref1back\\">1</a>.

To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.\\nMany decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the \u201cOODA loop,\u201d for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it\u2019s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic\u2019s definition: \u201cAgents are models using tools in a loop.\u201d1\\nOODA Loops for Agentic AI\\nTraditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don\u2019t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation), can ingest poisoned documents. Tool-calling application programming interfaces can execute untrusted code. Modern AI sensors can encompass the entire Internet; their environments are inherently adversarial. That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.\\nIn 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: \u201cprompt injection.\u201d2 Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison\u2019s insight was that this isn\u2019t just a filtering problem; it\u2019s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful\u2014treating all inputs uniformly\u2014is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.\\nInsecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.\\nAI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model\u2019s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren\u2019t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.\\nAI increasingly maintains state\u2014in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.\\nAgents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can\u2019t verify tool semantics, only syntax. \u201cSubmit SQL query\u201d might mean \u201cexfiltrate database\u201d because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.\\nFor example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom.\\nObserve: The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity.\\nOrient: The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model\u2019s worldview\u2014its orientation\u2014can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases.\\nDecide: The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment. The decision process itself becomes the payload. Models can be manipulated to trust malicious sources preferentially.\\nAct: The risks include output manipulation, tool confusion, and action hijacking. MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.\\nAI gives the old phrase \u201cinside your adversary\u2019s OODA loop\u201d new meaning. For Boyd\u2019s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren\u2019t just metaphorically inside; they\u2019re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that\u2019s where the data are. AI\u2019s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.\\nWorse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.\\nThe Source of the Problem\\nThe fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don\u2019t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.\\nPrompt injection might be unsolvable in today\u2019s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won\u2019t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.\\nThis is Ken Thompson\u2019s \u201ctrusting trust\u201d attack all over again.3 Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can\u2019t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.\\nThis is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart\u2014you can\u2019t verify your inputs. Smart and secure\u2014you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can\u2019t be used for this. Secure and fast\u2014you\u2019re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.\\nThis trilemma isn\u2019t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry\u2014when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model\u2019s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.\\nPrompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can\u2019t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can\u2019t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can\u2019t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can\u2019t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.\\nIn security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone\u2019s AI OODA loop uses the system\u2019s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn\u2019t a defect\u2014it\u2019s the feature working correctly.\\nWhere to Go Next?\\nThe shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more\u2014and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?\\nPhysical constraints protected Boyd\u2019s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn\u2019t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?\\nComputer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.4\\nTrustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can\u2019t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn\u2019t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.\\nAI OODA loops and integrity aren\u2019t fundamentally opposed, but today\u2019s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn\u2019t inside the loop by accident; it\u2019s there by architecture. Web-scale AI means web-scale integrity failure. Every capability corrupts.\\nIntegrity isn\u2019t a feature you add; it\u2019s an architecture you choose. So far, we have built AI systems where \u201cfast\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d preclude \u201csecure.\u201d We optimized for capability over verification, for accessing web-scale data over ensuring trust. AI agents will be even more powerful\u2014and increasingly autonomous. And without integrity, they will also be dangerous.\\nReferences\\n1. S. Willison, Simon Willison\u2019s Weblog, May 22, 2025.

Anyone seriously considering this option should check out the website <a href=\\"https://endof10.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">endof10.org</a>, which includes a plethora of tips and a DIY installation guide.</p>\\n<p><strong>Linux Mint </strong>is a great option for Linux newbies. Like most modern Linux versions, Mint will run on anything with a 64-bit CPU that has at least 2GB of memory, although 4GB is recommended. In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.</p>\\n<p>Linux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt. Mint and other flavors of Linux come with <strong>LibreOffice</strong>, which is an open source suite of tools that includes applications similar to Microsoft Office, and it can open, edit and save documents as Microsoft Office files.</p>\\n<p>If you\u2019d prefer to give Linux a test drive before installing it on a Windows PC, you can always just download it to a removable USB drive.

October\u2019s Patch Tuesday also marks the final month that Microsoft will ship security updates for Windows 10 systems. If you\u2019re running a Windows 10 PC and you\u2019re unable or unwilling to migrate to Windows 11, read on for other options.\\n\\nThe first zero-day bug addressed this month (CVE-2025-24990) involves a third-party modem driver called Agere Modem that\u2019s been bundled with Windows for the past two decades. Microsoft responded to active attacks on this flaw by completely removing the vulnerable driver from Windows.\\nThe other zero-day is CVE-2025-59230, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager (also known as RasMan), a service used to manage remote network connections through virtual private networks (VPNs) and dial-up networks.\\n\u201cWhile RasMan is a frequent flyer on Patch Tuesday, appearing more than 20 times since January 2022, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen it exploited in the wild as a zero day,\u201d said Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable.\\nNarang notes that Microsoft Office users should also take note of CVE-2025-59227 and CVE-2025-59234, a pair of remote code execution bugs that take advantage of \u201cPreview Pane,\u201d meaning that the target doesn\u2019t even need to open the file for exploitation to occur. To execute these flaws, an attacker would social engineer a target into previewing an email with a malicious Microsoft Office document.\\nSpeaking of Office, Microsoft quietly announced this week that Microsoft Word will now automatically save documents to OneDrive, Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. Users who are uncomfortable saving all of their documents to Microsoft\u2019s cloud can change this in Word\u2019s settings; ZDNet has a useful how-to on disabling this feature.\\nKev Breen, senior director of threat research at Immersive, called attention to CVE-2025-59287, a critical remote code execution bug in the Windows Server Update Service\xa0 (WSUS) \u2014 the very same Windows service responsible for downloading security patches for Windows Server versions. Microsoft says there are no signs this weakness is being exploited yet. But with a threat score of 9.8 out of possible 10 and marked \u201cexploitation more likely,\u201d CVE-2025-59287 can be exploited without authentication and is an easy \u201cpatch now\u201d candidate.\\n\u201cMicrosoft provides limited information, stating that an unauthenticated attacker with network access can send untrusted data to the WSUS server, resulting in deserialization and code execution,\u201d Breen wrote. \u201cAs WSUS is a trusted Windows service that is designed to update privileged files across the file system, an attacker would have free rein over the operating system and could potentially bypass some EDR detections that ignore or exclude the WSUS service.\u201d\\nFor more on other fixes from Redmond today, check out the SANS Internet Storm Center monthly roundup, which indexes all of the updates by severity and urgency.\\nWindows 10 isn\u2019t the only Microsoft OS that is reaching end-of-life today;\xa0Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Skype for Business 2016, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2, and Outlook 2016 are some of the other products that Microsoft is sunsetting today.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re running any Windows 10 systems, you\u2019ve probably already determined whether your PC meets the technical hardware specs recommended for the Windows 11 OS. If you\u2019re reluctant or unable to migrate a Windows 10 system to Windows 11, there are alternatives to simply continuing to use Windows 10 without ongoing security updates.\\nOne option is to pay for another year\u2019s worth of security updates through Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. The cost is just $30 if you don\u2019t have a Microsoft account, and apparently free if you register the PC to a Microsoft account. This video breakdown from Ask Your Computer Guy does a good job of walking Windows 10 users through this process. Microsoft emphasizes that ESU enrollment does not provide other types of fixes, feature improvements or product enhancements. It also does not come with technical support.\\n\\nIf your Windows 10 system is associated with a Microsoft account and signed in when you visit Windows Update, you should see an option to enroll in extended updates. Image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZH7MlvOoPM\\n\\nWindows 10 users also have the option of installing some flavor of Linux instead. Anyone seriously considering this option should check out the website endof10.org, which includes a plethora of tips and a DIY installation guide.\\nLinux Mint is a great option for Linux newbies. Like most modern Linux versions, Mint will run on anything with a 64-bit CPU that has at least 2GB of memory, although 4GB is recommended. In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.\\nLinux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt. Mint and other flavors of Linux come with LibreOffice, which is an open source suite of tools that includes applications similar to Microsoft Office, and it can open, edit and save documents as Microsoft Office files.\\nIf you\u2019d prefer to give Linux a test drive before installing it on a Windows PC, you can always just download it to a removable USB drive. From there, reboot the computer (with the removable drive plugged in) and select the option at startup to run the operating system from the external USB drive. If you don\u2019t see an option for that after restarting, try restarting again and hitting the F8 button, which should open a list of bootable drives.\xa0Here\u2019s a fairly thorough tutorial\xa0that walks through exactly how to do all this.\\nAnd if this is your first time trying out Linux, relax and have fun: The nice thing about a \u201clive\u201d version of Linux (as it\u2019s called when the operating system is run from a removable drive such as a CD or a USB stick) is that none of your changes persist after a reboot.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.</p></div>\\n<h2>BOTNETS R US</h2>\\n<p>Ferguson said he&#8217;s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet&#8217;s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once.

XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\nVideo footage of the assault taken by The LA Ten Four shows the man being punched, kicked and stomped on by several others. At least two of the attackers appear to be wearing SoCal Active Club t-shirts, identifiable as such by photos and videos posted from the vigil.\\n\\nA frame from video footage filmed by LA Ten Four of the assault, showing one of several men wearing shirts with SoCal Active Club\u2019s logo; the individual second from right of the photo in the SoCal Active Club t-shirt can be seen in the video kicking the man on the ground. Source: Youtube / ACatWithNews\\n\\nFrames from a video posted by Patriot Front, and shared by the main Active Club Telegram channel, showing several individuals wearing the same SoCal Active Club t-shirts at the same event before the alleged assault.\\nSoCal Active Club has not responded to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment on their apparent involvement in this assault as of publication.\\nWiley D.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat.

No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d.

Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right).

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions. For example, the Ukraine-Russia war has led to many videos of drones with attached thermite or other incendiary munitions burning as they fly over enemy positions. Similar incendiary munitions have also been used in Gaza. All these burn in a manner consistent with the incendiary munitions used in the attacks on the Family Boat and Alma.\\n\\nScreencaptures from attacks on the Family Boat, Alma and incendiary munition attacks in Gaza.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.\\nEchoes of the dot-com era\\nDespite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.\\nSpeaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.\\nDawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.\\nThe role of governments and global policy\\nPublic policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As Harvard Business Review pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.\\nChina has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.\\nMeanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists.

Validate all external input</strong>: Never trust data that crosses trust boundaries, especially in foundational libraries that process user input.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Disable dangerous features by default</strong>: Log4j now ships with JNDI lookups disabled by default.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Implement defense in depth</strong>: Modern applications need multiple layers of protection, from input validation to runtime protections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Automate security scanning</strong>: Tools like GitHub&rsquo;s code scanning and Dependabot can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>5. Maintain a software bills of materials (SBOMs)</strong>: When Log4Shell hit, many organizations couldn&rsquo;t determine if they were affected because they didn&rsquo;t know their dependencies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;I got phone calls from colleagues, asking me: &lsquo;Am I really affected?&rsquo; SBOMs give you a technical way to find out what dependencies you&rsquo;re using in a project,&rdquo; Christian explains.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"industry-wide-lessons-for-sustainable-open-source\\">Industry-wide lessons for sustainable open source</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the technical lessons from Log4Shell are crucial, technology changes aren&rsquo;t enough. The deeper challenge lies in how we support the humans who maintain the open source infrastructure our world depends on. This crisis exposed several systemic issues in how we approach open source sustainability and security:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Community is crucial</strong>: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re maintaining open source software, just as one single person, that&rsquo;s a risk,&rdquo; Christian emphasizes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Security training needs to be accessible</strong>: Traditional security education often doesn&rsquo;t reach the maintainers who need it most.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Funding alone isn&rsquo;t enough</strong>: While financial support helps, Christian found that training and community were equally important. When offered funding to pay team members, many declined due to tax implications or existing jobs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Kindness matters</strong>: &ldquo;Behind every small open source library, there&rsquo;s a human writing the code,&rdquo; Christian reminds us. &ldquo;If you find something that&rsquo;s not right, help out instead of being angry.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Security can be improved for every project</strong>: During the program, Christian implemented multiple new security improvements, including hardening GitHub Actions against script injections, developing a new threat model, and collaborating with ScanCode to identify hidden Log4j artifacts in third-party code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"your-role-in-securing-the-software-supply-chain\\">Your role in securing the software supply chain</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Log4Shell story isn&rsquo;t just about one vulnerability; it&rsquo;s about the collective responsibility we all share in maintaining the open source ecosystem that powers the modern internet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>For maintainers</strong>: Apply to programs like the <a href=\\"https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a>. <a href=\\"http://gh.io/protect-your-project\\">Enable built-in security tools</a> like GitHub&rsquo;s <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning\\">code scanning</a> and <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide\\">Dependabot</a>. <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository\\">Export SBOMs</a> to help downstream users understand their dependencies, and <a href=\\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories\\">publish security advisories</a> for all vulnerabilities found in your project.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>For enterprises: </strong>Become a Funding or Ecosystem Partner of the <a href=\\"https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund.</a> Invest engineering time in the upstream projects you depend on.

It will basically break all software.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nWhen asked if the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund training could have prevented Log4Shell, Christian is direct: \u201cIf this training had existed five years ago, maybe Log4Shell wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\\nTechnical lessons: Building security by default\\nThe Log4Shell incident taught the industry several critical lessons about secure development practices:\\n1. Validate all external input: Never trust data that crosses trust boundaries, especially in foundational libraries that process user input.\\n2. Disable dangerous features by default: Log4j now ships with JNDI lookups disabled by default.\xa0\\n3. Implement defense in depth: Modern applications need multiple layers of protection, from input validation to runtime protections.\\n4. Automate security scanning: Tools like GitHub\u2019s code scanning and Dependabot can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.\\n5. Maintain a software bills of materials (SBOMs): When Log4Shell hit, many organizations couldn\u2019t determine if they were affected because they didn\u2019t know their dependencies.\\n\u201cI got phone calls from colleagues, asking me: \u2018Am I really affected?\u2019 SBOMs give you a technical way to find out what dependencies you\u2019re using in a project,\u201d Christian explains.\xa0\\nIndustry-wide lessons for sustainable open source\\nWhile the technical lessons from Log4Shell are crucial, technology changes aren\u2019t enough. The deeper challenge lies in how we support the humans who maintain the open source infrastructure our world depends on. This crisis exposed several systemic issues in how we approach open source sustainability and security:\\nCommunity is crucial: \u201cIf you\u2019re maintaining open source software, just as one single person, that\u2019s a risk,\u201d Christian emphasizes.\\nSecurity training needs to be accessible: Traditional security education often doesn\u2019t reach the maintainers who need it most.\\nFunding alone isn\u2019t enough: While financial support helps, Christian found that training and community were equally important. When offered funding to pay team members, many declined due to tax implications or existing jobs.\\nKindness matters: \u201cBehind every small open source library, there\u2019s a human writing the code,\u201d Christian reminds us. \u201cIf you find something that\u2019s not right, help out instead of being angry.\u201d\\nSecurity can be improved for every project: During the program, Christian implemented multiple new security improvements, including hardening GitHub Actions against script injections, developing a new threat model, and collaborating with ScanCode to identify hidden Log4j artifacts in third-party code.\\nYour role in securing the software supply chain\\nThe Log4Shell story isn\u2019t just about one vulnerability; it\u2019s about the collective responsibility we all share in maintaining the open source ecosystem that powers the modern internet.\\nFor maintainers: Apply to programs like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Enable built-in security tools like GitHub\u2019s code scanning and Dependabot. Export SBOMs to help downstream users understand their dependencies, and publish security advisories for all vulnerabilities found in your project.\\nFor enterprises: Become a Funding or Ecosystem Partner of the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Invest engineering time in the upstream projects you depend on. Don\u2019t just consume open source\u2014contribute with code, documentation, security reviews, and funding.\\nFor individual developers: Select carefully the new dependencies that you pull in, for example by checking their security posture. Consider the data you process may be attacker controlled and strictly validate untrusted inputs to prevent unintended behavior. Contribute test cases and documentation.\\nThe path forward\\nToday, Log4j has an 8.3 OpenSSF score, which demonstrates good security practices.\\nBut the broader lesson extends beyond any single project. As Christian puts it:\\nLearning is the only cure for ignorance. So just keep learning.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nThe Log4Shell incident showed us how quickly our digital world can be threatened by a single vulnerability. But it also demonstrated the power of the open source community to respond, adapt, and improve. The question isn\u2019t whether the next critical vulnerability will emerge\u2014it\u2019s whether we\u2019ll be ready for it.\\nReady to strengthen your open source project\u2019s security? The GitHub Secure Open Source Fund provides funding, training, and resources to help maintainers build more secure software:\\nProjects and Maintainers: Apply now to the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund and help make open source safer for everyone.\\nFunding and Ecosystem Partners: Become a Funding or Ecosystem Partner and support a more secure open source future.

(Which is most of us.) And that\u2019s okay!\xa0\\nThe good news is that GitHub Universe was designed for folks like you. This isn\u2019t just one long conference in a room with thousands of people and no exit. Universe offers all sorts of opportunities to take breaks, hang in small groups, or watch virtually, so that you can learn and network at whatever pace works for you. We\u2019ve built in events to make the experience extra comfortable, safe, and exciting for all.\\n[Get your IRL pass]\\nIf you\u2019ve already got your pass but are feeling a bit shaky on how it\u2019ll all go, here are some practical tips for how to navigate tech conferences, like GitHub Universe.\\n1. Attend smaller sessions or workshops\\nInstead of signing up for the largest, busiest sessions, go for the smaller workshops, niche panels, and breakout sessions. Small-group sessions often foster deeper connections and conversations, and they can help keep you from getting lost in the crowd.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s Universe will feature many interactive workshops (explore the full list), where the guest list will be small, and the conversations will be deep. You can also add demo-style sandbox sessions to your agenda, which include practical exercises, to keep your mind engaged!\xa0\\nYou may also want to check out gatherings in our discussions lounge, where two to three facilitators will guide small groups through specific topics of interest, prioritizing active participation and collaboration.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Find quiet zones and recharge spaces\\nWe all know that introverts recharge alone. So if you need to step away and take some time to reflect, you should!\\nAt Universe, we\u2019ve created dedicated lounges and recharge spaces, so you don\u2019t have to choose between skipping content and protecting your peace. Need a few minutes to unwind? We\u2019ll have a quiet room for phone-free decompression, meditation, and prayer. We\u2019ll also have plenty of drink options, snacks, and meals available if you need to keep your blood sugar up.\\nAnd don\u2019t forget to step outside and take in the stunning waterfront views at Fort Mason\u2014a quick breath of ocean air can do wonders between sessions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Join curated networking activities\\nIf large mixers without a planned topic of conversation feel daunting, you can look for guided or themed activities where the conversation already has a starting point.\xa0\\nAt Universe, you can connect with people who share your passions at structured networking meetup spots, including:\xa0\\nRecess!: Meet fellow attendees over your shared interests beyond the code. Whether you\u2019re a Lego enthusiast or a die-hard Swiftie, there\u2019s an opportunity for everyone to connect and simply have fun.\\nMakerspace: Create interactive projects, from art to AI and music to robotics. Whether you build or just tinker, this is your playground.\\nOpen Source Zone: Connect with contributors and maintainers, explore open source projects, and celebrate the power of community-led software.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Set personal goals and boundaries\\nDecide ahead of time what you want to get out of the event. Take a look at the agenda. What are your must-see sessions? Who are the people you want to meet? Build in plenty of breaks\u2014without guilt!\xa0\\nDid you know that we offer a Universe agenda builder, curated schedules, and content tracks, so you can figure out the right sessions for your interests and goals?

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on <em>real</em> repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.</p>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"from-idea-to-merge-in-record-time-%e2%9a%a1\\">From idea to merge in record time &#9889;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext-edit suggestions: Copilot predicts the next change you\u2019ll make and offers it inline. One Tab and you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow-latency completions: Most Copilot responses now render in under 400 ms (fast enough that you stop noticing them).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopilot CLI: The same brains, now in your terminal. Setup, debug, and script without switching windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMulti-model routing: Different jobs call for different brains. Copilot gives you access to multiple LLMs from leading frontier AI firms.\xa0\\nThe result: fewer interruptions, faster loops, and a workflow that finally keeps pace with how you think.\\nAI that scales with your workflow \ud83d\udcd0\\nCopilot doesn\u2019t live in a new environment you need to learn. It\u2019s part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\xa0\\nJetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity: Same Copilot, wherever you build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom instructions: Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGitHub MCP Server: Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkspace prompt files: Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20M+ developers strong: Every Copilot update compounds through the world\u2019s largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\\nCopilot isn\u2019t a separate tool you \u201cadd\u201d to GitHub. It\u2019s part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\\nSmarter, cleaner, and safer code \ud83d\udd0d\\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know). We\u2019ve spent a lot of cycles quietly leveling up Copilot\u2019s overall code quality and security guardrails where they matter most to you.\xa0\\nCopilot Autofix: Detects and patches vulnerabilities automatically (it was used to fix over a million vulnerabilities this year alone).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCode review: Summarizes diffs, flags logic bugs, and suggests fixes right inside your pull requests with a tool that powers millions of code reviews a month on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImproved model reasoning: Generates more readable, test-passing code with fewer lint errors and less regressions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL integration: Integrations with GitHub Advanced Security, Dependabot, and GitHub Actions keeps your supply chain solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilt-in privacy: Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant-level control mean your work stays off the grid.\xa0\\nOur research shows new code written with Copilot tends to have higher readability, better reliability, and improved maintainability scores.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s the good news: Copilot\u2019s backed by the same security stack that protects the world\u2019s largest open source ecosystem and more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal talk: Copilot vs. the rest \ud83d\udc40\\nLet\u2019s be honest: there are some great tools out there that make agentic coding workflows feel intuitive and bring real polish to multi-file editing.\xa0\\nCopilot lives in GitHub.

We evaluate Phi-2, Llama-2-7B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4 across four distinct attack categories: human-written prompts, AutoDAN, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), and Tree-of-Attacks-with-pruning (TAP). Our comprehensive evaluation employs 1,200 carefully stratified prompts from the SALAD-Bench dataset, spanning six harm categories. Results demonstrate significant variations in model robustness, with Llama-2 achieving the highest overall security (3.4% average attack success rate) while Phi-2 exhibits the greatest vulnerability (7.0% average attack success rate).

Now, initiatives like the <a href=\\"https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a> are working to make sure it never happens again.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It all started a few hours earlier on a cold November day, when Christian, who is a maintainer of the open source project Log4j, planned to spend time playing games with his son. Instead, he found himself staring at his phone, watching notifications pile up in his inbox&mdash;10, then 20 emails flooding in. When he saw the words &ldquo;remote code execution,&rdquo; his first thought was: &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m on the wrong mailing list.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t. And within hours, Christian would be at the center of what became known as Log4Shell: the most severe vulnerability in internet history, affecting billions of devices from Fortune 500 companies to Minecraft servers worldwide.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;I told my son, I will play with you in like five minutes,&rdquo; Christian recalls. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t see me for the next couple of days.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Watch the full interview with Christian Grobmeier and Gregg Cochran, staff program manager at GitHub, above. &#128070;</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-ubiquity-that-made-log4shell-a-perfect-storm\\">The ubiquity that made Log4Shell a perfect storm</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Log4j is foundational software. This 20+ year-old Java logging library quietly powers system events in applications worldwide, like user logins and calculation results. But this small piece of software had quietly become a dependency in thousands of projects across the Java ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Log4j is such a small, tiny library. But everybody can use it in their software.</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That ubiquity made Log4Shell devastating. Financial services companies relied on it for compliance auditing. E-commerce systems used it to track security incidents. Insurance companies needed it to monitor their software behavior. In a 2022 Tidelift survey, 49% of open source developers reported that their organization relies on Java&mdash;and most of them were using Log4j without even knowing it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Christian realized the scope of the vulnerability, the weight hit him immediately: &ldquo;Literally all Java applications in the world could be affected. Even 10% would be a major problem. This would be catastrophic.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-a-vulnerability-that-scored-a-perfect-10\\">A vulnerability that scored a perfect 10</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Log4Shell reveals how a seemingly innocent feature became an attack vector. Log4j used <a href=\\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19747-01/819-0076/jndi.html\\">Java&rsquo;s Naming and Directory Interface</a> (JNDI) to provide flexibility, allowing developers to load software components from remote servers. But the library didn&rsquo;t validate whether JNDI lookup strings were coming from trusted sources.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;How can a string break the internet?&rdquo; Christian asks.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The exploitation was frighteningly simple. An attacker could input a malicious JNDI string into any application field that gets logged&mdash;a username field, a search box, even a Minecraft chat message&mdash;and execute remote code on the target system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\\"wp-block-code language-plaintext\\"><code>jndi:&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;server-name&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path-to-object&gt;</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even need to have special knowledge,&rdquo; Christian notes. &ldquo;You just run around and push the string wherever you want it.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\"purple-text text-gradient-purple-coral\\" style=\\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\\"><strong>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) gave Log4Shell a perfect 10: the highest possible score.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\"purple-text text-gradient-purple-coral\\" style=\\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\\">&ldquo;The first time I heard about this score, I thought, maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; Christian remembers. &ldquo;And then after a couple of days, I thought, yeah, <strong>maybe we should extend this to a score of 15 or 20.</strong>&ldquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"the-human-cost-of-maintaining-critical-infrastructure\\">The human cost of maintaining critical infrastructure</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The personal toll on maintainers during the Log4Shell crisis reveals the hidden human cost of our software supply chain. Christian and his team, mostly volunteers, suddenly found themselves responsible for patching a vulnerability affecting half the internet. The pressure was immense and deeply personal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Some of us stopped sleeping. We all felt that either we fix it right now in the next few days, or we close this project.</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fixing the initial vulnerability led to the discovery of additional issues, creating what Christian describes as &ldquo;a bag of water with a hole. When you patch the hole, you see another one.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, the community response was mixed. &ldquo;On the one hand, you have people who really hate you, and on the other hand, you have people who are really behind you,&rdquo; Christian explains.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps most telling:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Nobody stops in to check on you. They check on the project. There&rsquo;s also nobody standing up and saying, &lsquo;hey, thank you for the good work you&rsquo;re doing to remediate this issue.&rsquo;</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"how-the-github-secure-open-source-fund-is-strengthening-security\\">How the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund is strengthening security</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Log4Shell incident highlighted a critical gap in open source security: Maintainers often lack the training and resources to build security into their projects from the ground up. This realization sparked initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund, which provides both funding and security training to critical open source projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The fund has been effective and efficient as a form of proactive protection, pooled resources, and shared responsibility. Think of it as &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; for the open source supply chain&mdash;helping make the digital ecosystem safer and reducing risks that could impact billions of users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Christian participated in the <a href=\\"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects/\\">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a> security training program, and the impact was transformative.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The training didn&rsquo;t just provide technical knowledge&mdash;it shifted his perspective. Christian explains, &ldquo;With this training, developers are no longer the weakest link. Instead, they&rsquo;re the first line of defense.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This change in mindset is crucial. As Christian puts it:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\">\\n<p>Ignorance is by far the worst and most critical security hole. It will basically break all software.</p>\\n<cite>Christian Grobmeier</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked if the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund training could have prevented Log4Shell, Christian is direct: &ldquo;If this training had existed five years ago, maybe Log4Shell wouldn&rsquo;t be here today.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"technical-lessons-building-security-by-default\\">Technical lessons: Building security by default</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Log4Shell incident taught the industry several critical lessons about secure development practices:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>1. Validate all external input</strong>: Never trust data that crosses trust boundaries, especially in foundational libraries that process user input.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Disable dangerous features by default</strong>: Log4j now ships with JNDI lookups disabled by default.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Implement defense in depth</strong>: Modern applications need multiple layers of protection, from input validation to runtime protections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Automate security scanning</strong>: Tools like GitHub&rsquo;s code scanning and Dependabot can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>5.

Now, initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund are working to make sure it never happens again.\\nIt all started a few hours earlier on a cold November day, when Christian, who is a maintainer of the open source project Log4j, planned to spend time playing games with his son. Instead, he found himself staring at his phone, watching notifications pile up in his inbox\u201410, then 20 emails flooding in. When he saw the words \u201cremote code execution,\u201d his first thought was: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m on the wrong mailing list.\u201d\\nHe wasn\u2019t. And within hours, Christian would be at the center of what became known as Log4Shell: the most severe vulnerability in internet history, affecting billions of devices from Fortune 500 companies to Minecraft servers worldwide.\\n\u201cI told my son, I will play with you in like five minutes,\u201d Christian recalls. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t see me for the next couple of days.\u201d\\n\\nWatch the full interview with Christian Grobmeier and Gregg Cochran, staff program manager at GitHub, above. \ud83d\udc46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ubiquity that made Log4Shell a perfect storm\\nLog4j is foundational software. This 20+ year-old Java logging library quietly powers system events in applications worldwide, like user logins and calculation results. But this small piece of software had quietly become a dependency in thousands of projects across the Java ecosystem.\\nLog4j is such a small, tiny library. But everybody can use it in their software.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nThat ubiquity made Log4Shell devastating. Financial services companies relied on it for compliance auditing. E-commerce systems used it to track security incidents. Insurance companies needed it to monitor their software behavior. In a 2022 Tidelift survey, 49% of open source developers reported that their organization relies on Java\u2014and most of them were using Log4j without even knowing it.\\nWhen Christian realized the scope of the vulnerability, the weight hit him immediately: \u201cLiterally all Java applications in the world could be affected. Even 10% would be a major problem. This would be catastrophic.\u201d\\nA vulnerability that scored a perfect 10\\nLog4Shell reveals how a seemingly innocent feature became an attack vector. Log4j used Java\u2019s Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to provide flexibility, allowing developers to load software components from remote servers. But the library didn\u2019t validate whether JNDI lookup strings were coming from trusted sources.\\n\u201cHow can a string break the internet?\u201d Christian asks.\xa0\\nThe exploitation was frighteningly simple. An attacker could input a malicious JNDI string into any application field that gets logged\u2014a username field, a search box, even a Minecraft chat message\u2014and execute remote code on the target system.\\njndi:<protocol>://<server-name>:<port>/<path-to-object>\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have special knowledge,\u201d Christian notes. \u201cYou just run around and push the string wherever you want it.\u201d\\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) gave Log4Shell a perfect 10: the highest possible score.\\n\u201cThe first time I heard about this score, I thought, maybe it\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Christian remembers. \u201cAnd then after a couple of days, I thought, yeah, maybe we should extend this to a score of 15 or 20.\u201c\\nThe human cost of maintaining critical infrastructure\\nThe personal toll on maintainers during the Log4Shell crisis reveals the hidden human cost of our software supply chain. Christian and his team, mostly volunteers, suddenly found themselves responsible for patching a vulnerability affecting half the internet. The pressure was immense and deeply personal.\\nSome of us stopped sleeping. We all felt that either we fix it right now in the next few days, or we close this project.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nFixing the initial vulnerability led to the discovery of additional issues, creating what Christian describes as \u201ca bag of water with a hole. When you patch the hole, you see another one.\u201d\\nMeanwhile, the community response was mixed. \u201cOn the one hand, you have people who really hate you, and on the other hand, you have people who are really behind you,\u201d Christian explains.\xa0\\nPerhaps most telling:\\nNobody stops in to check on you. They check on the project. There\u2019s also nobody standing up and saying, \u2018hey, thank you for the good work you\u2019re doing to remediate this issue.\u2019\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nHow the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund is strengthening security\\nThe Log4Shell incident highlighted a critical gap in open source security: Maintainers often lack the training and resources to build security into their projects from the ground up. This realization sparked initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund, which provides both funding and security training to critical open source projects.\\nThe fund has been effective and efficient as a form of proactive protection, pooled resources, and shared responsibility. Think of it as \u201cinsurance\u201d for the open source supply chain\u2014helping make the digital ecosystem safer and reducing risks that could impact billions of users.\\nChristian participated in the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund security training program, and the impact was transformative.\\nThe training didn\u2019t just provide technical knowledge\u2014it shifted his perspective. Christian explains, \u201cWith this training, developers are no longer the weakest link. Instead, they\u2019re the first line of defense.\u201d\\nThis change in mindset is crucial. As Christian puts it:\\nIgnorance is by far the worst and most critical security hole. It will basically break all software.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nWhen asked if the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund training could have prevented Log4Shell, Christian is direct: \u201cIf this training had existed five years ago, maybe Log4Shell wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\\nTechnical lessons: Building security by default\\nThe Log4Shell incident taught the industry several critical lessons about secure development practices:\\n1. Validate all external input: Never trust data that crosses trust boundaries, especially in foundational libraries that process user input.\\n2. Disable dangerous features by default: Log4j now ships with JNDI lookups disabled by default.\xa0\\n3. Implement defense in depth: Modern applications need multiple layers of protection, from input validation to runtime protections.\\n4. Automate security scanning: Tools like GitHub\u2019s code scanning and Dependabot can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.\\n5. Maintain a software bills of materials (SBOMs): When Log4Shell hit, many organizations couldn\u2019t determine if they were affected because they didn\u2019t know their dependencies.\\n\u201cI got phone calls from colleagues, asking me: \u2018Am I really affected?\u2019 SBOMs give you a technical way to find out what dependencies you\u2019re using in a project,\u201d Christian explains.\xa0\\nIndustry-wide lessons for sustainable open source\\nWhile the technical lessons from Log4Shell are crucial, technology changes aren\u2019t enough. The deeper challenge lies in how we support the humans who maintain the open source infrastructure our world depends on. This crisis exposed several systemic issues in how we approach open source sustainability and security:\\nCommunity is crucial: \u201cIf you\u2019re maintaining open source software, just as one single person, that\u2019s a risk,\u201d Christian emphasizes.\\nSecurity training needs to be accessible: Traditional security education often doesn\u2019t reach the maintainers who need it most.\\nFunding alone isn\u2019t enough: While financial support helps, Christian found that training and community were equally important. When offered funding to pay team members, many declined due to tax implications or existing jobs.\\nKindness matters: \u201cBehind every small open source library, there\u2019s a human writing the code,\u201d Christian reminds us. \u201cIf you find something that\u2019s not right, help out instead of being angry.\u201d\\nSecurity can be improved for every project: During the program, Christian implemented multiple new security improvements, including hardening GitHub Actions against script injections, developing a new threat model, and collaborating with ScanCode to identify hidden Log4j artifacts in third-party code.\\nYour role in securing the software supply chain\\nThe Log4Shell story isn\u2019t just about one vulnerability; it\u2019s about the collective responsibility we all share in maintaining the open source ecosystem that powers the modern internet.\\nFor maintainers: Apply to programs like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Enable built-in security tools like GitHub\u2019s code scanning and Dependabot. Export SBOMs to help downstream users understand their dependencies, and publish security advisories for all vulnerabilities found in your project.\\nFor enterprises: Become a Funding or Ecosystem Partner of the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Invest engineering time in the upstream projects you depend on. Don\u2019t just consume open source\u2014contribute with code, documentation, security reviews, and funding.\\nFor individual developers: Select carefully the new dependencies that you pull in, for example by checking their security posture. Consider the data you process may be attacker controlled and strictly validate untrusted inputs to prevent unintended behavior. Contribute test cases and documentation.\\nThe path forward\\nToday, Log4j has an 8.3 OpenSSF score, which demonstrates good security practices.\\nBut the broader lesson extends beyond any single project. As Christian puts it:\\nLearning is the only cure for ignorance. So just keep learning.\\nChristian Grobmeier\\nThe Log4Shell incident showed us how quickly our digital world can be threatened by a single vulnerability. But it also demonstrated the power of the open source community to respond, adapt, and improve. The question isn\u2019t whether the next critical vulnerability will emerge\u2014it\u2019s whether we\u2019ll be ready for it.\\nReady to strengthen your open source project\u2019s security?

To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.</b></p>\\n<p>Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the &#8220;OODA loop,&#8221; for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it&#8217;s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic&#8217;s definition: &#8220;Agents are models using tools in a loop.&#8221;<sup><a id=\\"ref1back\\" href=\\"#ref1\\">1</a></sup></p>\\n<h3>OODA Loops for Agentic AI</h3>\\n<p>Traditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don&#8217;t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation</a>), can ingest poisoned documents. Tool-calling application programming interfaces can execute untrusted code. Modern AI sensors can encompass the entire Internet; their environments are inherently adversarial. That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.</p>\\n<p>In 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: &#8220;prompt injection.&#8221;<sup><a id=\\"ref2back\\" href=\\"#ref2\\">2</a></sup> Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison&#8217;s insight was that this isn&#8217;t just a filtering problem; it&#8217;s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful&#8212;treating all inputs uniformly&#8212;is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Insecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.</li>\\n<li>AI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model&#8217;s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren&#8217;t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>AI increasingly maintains state&#8212;in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.</li>\\n<li>Agents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can&#8217;t verify tool semantics, only syntax. &#8220;Submit SQL query&#8221; might mean &#8220;exfiltrate database&#8221; because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>For example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>Observe:</em> The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity.</li>\\n<li><em>Orient:</em> The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model&#8217;s worldview&#8212;its orientation&#8212;can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases.</li>\\n<li><em>Decide:</em> The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment. The decision process itself becomes the payload. Models can be manipulated to trust malicious sources preferentially.</li>\\n<li><em>Act:</em> The risks include output manipulation, tool confusion, and action hijacking. MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>AI gives the old phrase &#8220;inside your adversary&#8217;s OODA loop&#8221; new meaning. For Boyd&#8217;s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren&#8217;t just metaphorically inside; they&#8217;re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that&#8217;s where the data are. AI&#8217;s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.</p>\\n<p>Worse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.</p>\\n<h3>The Source of the Problem</h3>\\n<p>The fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don&#8217;t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.</p>\\n<p>Prompt injection might be unsolvable in today&#8217;s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won&#8217;t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.</p>\\n<p>This is Ken Thompson&#8217;s &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack all over again.<sup><a id=\\"ref3back\\" href=\\"#ref3\\">3</a></sup> Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can&#8217;t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.</p>\\n<p>This is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart&#8212;you can&#8217;t verify your inputs. Smart and secure&#8212;you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can&#8217;t be used for this. Secure and fast&#8212;you&#8217;re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.</p>\\n<p>This trilemma isn&#8217;t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry&#8212;when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model&#8217;s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.</p>\\n<p>Prompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can&#8217;t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can&#8217;t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can&#8217;t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can&#8217;t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.</p>\\n<p>In security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone\u2019s AI OODA loop uses the system&#8217;s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn&#8217;t a defect&#8212;it&#8217;s the feature working correctly.</p>\\n<h3>Where to Go Next?</h3>\\n<p>The shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more&#8212;and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?</p>\\n<p>Physical constraints protected Boyd&#8217;s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn&#8217;t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?</p>\\n<p>Computer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.<sup><a id=\\"ref4back\\" href=\\"#ref4\\">4</a></sup></p>\\n<p>Trustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can&#8217;t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn&#8217;t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.</p>\\n<p>AI OODA loops and integrity aren&#8217;t fundamentally opposed, but today&#8217;s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn&#8217;t inside the loop by accident; it&#8217;s there by architecture. Web-scale AI means web-scale integrity failure. Every capability corrupts.</p>\\n<p style=\\"padding-top: 1em;\\">Integrity isn&#8217;t a feature you add; it&#8217;s an architecture you choose. So far, we have built AI systems where &#8220;fast&#8221; and &#8220;smart&#8221; preclude &#8220;secure.&#8221; We optimized for capability over verification, for accessing web-scale data over ensuring trust. AI agents will be even more powerful&#8212;and increasingly autonomous. And without integrity, they will also be dangerous.</p>\\n<h4>References</h4>\\n<p><a id=\\"ref1\\" href=\\"#ref1back\\">1</a>.

That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.\\nIn 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: \u201cprompt injection.\u201d2 Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison\u2019s insight was that this isn\u2019t just a filtering problem; it\u2019s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful\u2014treating all inputs uniformly\u2014is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.\\nInsecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.\\nAI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model\u2019s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren\u2019t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.\\nAI increasingly maintains state\u2014in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.\\nAgents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can\u2019t verify tool semantics, only syntax. \u201cSubmit SQL query\u201d might mean \u201cexfiltrate database\u201d because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.\\nFor example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom.\\nObserve: The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity.\\nOrient: The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model\u2019s worldview\u2014its orientation\u2014can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases.\\nDecide: The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment. The decision process itself becomes the payload. Models can be manipulated to trust malicious sources preferentially.\\nAct: The risks include output manipulation, tool confusion, and action hijacking. MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.\\nAI gives the old phrase \u201cinside your adversary\u2019s OODA loop\u201d new meaning. For Boyd\u2019s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren\u2019t just metaphorically inside; they\u2019re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that\u2019s where the data are. AI\u2019s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.\\nWorse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.\\nThe Source of the Problem\\nThe fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don\u2019t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.\\nPrompt injection might be unsolvable in today\u2019s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won\u2019t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.\\nThis is Ken Thompson\u2019s \u201ctrusting trust\u201d attack all over again.3 Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can\u2019t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.\\nThis is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart\u2014you can\u2019t verify your inputs. Smart and secure\u2014you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can\u2019t be used for this. Secure and fast\u2014you\u2019re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.\\nThis trilemma isn\u2019t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry\u2014when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model\u2019s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.\\nPrompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can\u2019t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can\u2019t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can\u2019t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can\u2019t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.\\nIn security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone\u2019s AI OODA loop uses the system\u2019s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn\u2019t a defect\u2014it\u2019s the feature working correctly.\\nWhere to Go Next?\\nThe shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more\u2014and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?\\nPhysical constraints protected Boyd\u2019s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn\u2019t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?\\nComputer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.4\\nTrustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can\u2019t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn\u2019t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.\\nAI OODA loops and integrity aren\u2019t fundamentally opposed, but today\u2019s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn\u2019t inside the loop by accident; it\u2019s there by architecture. Web-scale AI means web-scale integrity failure. Every capability corrupts.\\nIntegrity isn\u2019t a feature you add; it\u2019s an architecture you choose. So far, we have built AI systems where \u201cfast\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d preclude \u201csecure.\u201d We optimized for capability over verification, for accessing web-scale data over ensuring trust. AI agents will be even more powerful\u2014and increasingly autonomous. And without integrity, they will also be dangerous.\\nReferences\\n1. S. Willison, Simon Willison\u2019s Weblog, May 22, 2025.

We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.\\nMany decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the \u201cOODA loop,\u201d for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it\u2019s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic\u2019s definition: \u201cAgents are models using tools in a loop.\u201d1\\nOODA Loops for Agentic AI\\nTraditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don\u2019t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation), can ingest poisoned documents.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour&#8217;s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Published in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-challenge-of-somatic-variants\\">The challenge of somatic variants</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by &#8216;somatic&#8217; variants acquired after birth rather than inherited &#8216;germline&#8217; variants from parents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Somatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Identifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-deepsomatic-works\\">How DeepSomatic works</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren&#8217;t inherited. These variations reveal what&#8217;s fuelling the tumour&#8217;s growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual&#8217;s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic can also work in &#8216;tumour-only&#8217; mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-training-a-more-precise-ai-cancer-research-tool\\">Training a more precise AI cancer research tool</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Training an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors. The data shows how even the same cancer type can have vastly different mutational signatures, information that can help predict patient response to specific treatments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic models performed better than other established methods across all three major sequencing platforms. The tool excelled at identifying complex mutations called insertions and deletions, or &#8216;Indels&#8217;. For these variants, DeepSomatic achieved a 90% F1-score on Illumina sequencing data, compared to 80% for the next-best method. The improvement was more dramatic on Pacific Biosciences data, where DeepSomatic scored over 80% while the next-best tool scored less than 50%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI performed well when analysing challenging samples. Testing included a breast cancer sample preserved with formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE), a common method that can introduce DNA damage and complicate analysis. It was also tested on data from whole exome sequencing (WES), a more affordable method that sequences only the 1% of the genome coding for proteins. In both scenarios, DeepSomatic outperformed other tools, suggesting its utility for analysing lower-quality or historical samples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-an-ai-tool-for-all-cancers\\">An AI tool for all cancers</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI tool has shown it can apply its learning to new cancer types it wasn&#8217;t trained on. When used to analyse a glioblastoma sample, an aggressive brain cancer, it successfully pinpointed the few variants known to drive the disease. In a partnership with Children&#8217;s Mercy in Kansas City, it analysed eight samples of paediatric leukaemia and found the previously known variants while identifying 10 new ones, despite working with tumour-only samples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Google hopes research labs and clinicians will adopt this tool to better understand individual tumours. By detecting known cancer variants, it could help guide choices for existing treatments. By identifying new ones, it could lead to new therapies.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour\u2019s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.\\nPublished in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.\\nThe challenge of somatic variants\\nCancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by \u2018somatic\u2019 variants acquired after birth rather than inherited \u2018germline\u2019 variants from parents.\\nSomatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.\\nIdentifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.\\nHow DeepSomatic works\\nIn clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren\u2019t inherited. These variations reveal what\u2019s fuelling the tumour\u2019s growth.\\nThe model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual\u2019s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.\\nDeepSomatic can also work in \u2018tumour-only\u2019 mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.\\nTraining a more precise AI cancer research tool\\nTraining an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.\\nThese samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors. The data shows how even the same cancer type can have vastly different mutational signatures, information that can help predict patient response to specific treatments.\\nDeepSomatic models performed better than other established methods across all three major sequencing platforms. The tool excelled at identifying complex mutations called insertions and deletions, or \u2018Indels\u2019. For these variants, DeepSomatic achieved a 90% F1-score on Illumina sequencing data, compared to 80% for the next-best method. The improvement was more dramatic on Pacific Biosciences data, where DeepSomatic scored over 80% while the next-best tool scored less than 50%.\\nThe AI performed well when analysing challenging samples. Testing included a breast cancer sample preserved with formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE), a common method that can introduce DNA damage and complicate analysis. It was also tested on data from whole exome sequencing (WES), a more affordable method that sequences only the 1% of the genome coding for proteins. In both scenarios, DeepSomatic outperformed other tools, suggesting its utility for analysing lower-quality or historical samples.\\nAn AI tool for all cancers\\nThe AI tool has shown it can apply its learning to new cancer types it wasn\u2019t trained on. When used to analyse a glioblastoma sample, an aggressive brain cancer, it successfully pinpointed the few variants known to drive the disease. In a partnership with Children\u2019s Mercy in Kansas City, it analysed eight samples of paediatric leukaemia and found the previously known variants while identifying 10 new ones, despite working with tumour-only samples.\\nGoogle hopes research labs and clinicians will adopt this tool to better understand individual tumours. By detecting known cancer variants, it could help guide choices for existing treatments. By identifying new ones, it could lead to new therapies. The goal is to advance precision medicine and deliver more effective treatments to patients.\\nSee also: MHRA fast-tracks next wave of AI tools for patient care\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-echoes-of-the-dot-com-era\\">Echoes of the dot-com era</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Despite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Speaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-role-of-governments-and-global-policy\\">The role of governments and global policy</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Public policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As <em><a href=\\"https://hbr.org/2025/10/is-ai-a-boom-or-a-bubble\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Harvard Business Review</a></em> pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>China has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-market-warnings-over-a-possible-ai-bubble\\">Market warnings over a possible AI bubble</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-building-long-term-ai-infrastructure-amid-bubble-fears\\">Building long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn\u2019t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what\u2019s coming.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Miceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,\u201d he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-different-shades-of-caution\\">Different shades of caution</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across the industry, opinions vary on whether AI\u2019s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to <em><em><a href=\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/opinions-split-over-ai-bubble-after-billions-invested-2025-10-16/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Reuters</a></em></em>, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore\u2019s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding \u201chuge multiples\u201d despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones \u2014 though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable. He said the long-term case for AI investment is strong, but the ultimate winners are still uncertain given how quickly technology changes and how easily companies can switch providers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, ABB CEO Morten Wierod told <em>Reuters</em> that while he doesn\u2019t see an AI bubble, supply chain and construction limits could slow the rollout of new data centres.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.\\nEchoes of the dot-com era\\nDespite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.\\nSpeaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.\\nDawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.\\nThe role of governments and global policy\\nPublic policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As Harvard Business Review pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.\\nChina has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.\\nMeanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.\\nFor businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.\\nMarket warnings over a possible AI bubble\\nThe Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.\\nThis concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.\\nBuilding long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears\\nWhen asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.\\nRather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn\u2019t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what\u2019s coming.\\nMiceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,\u201d he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.\\nDifferent shades of caution\\nAcross the industry, opinions vary on whether AI\u2019s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.\\nAccording to Reuters, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore\u2019s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding \u201chuge multiples\u201d despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.\\nJeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones \u2014 though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.\\nAt Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable. He said the long-term case for AI investment is strong, but the ultimate winners are still uncertain given how quickly technology changes and how easily companies can switch providers.\\nMeanwhile, ABB CEO Morten Wierod told Reuters that while he doesn\u2019t see an AI bubble, supply chain and construction limits could slow the rollout of new data centres. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas added that even if there\u2019s a downturn, it\u2019s unlikely to cause a systemic financial crisis since AI investments aren\u2019t debt-driven.\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman also acknowledged market overexcitement, predicting that some investors will lose large sums while others will profit heavily \u2014 an outcome that mirrors past technology bubbles.\\nDespite growing talk of an AI bubble, many investors remain committed to the sector. UBS equity strategists said that about 90% of investors who think the market is overheated are still holding AI-related assets, suggesting most believe the industry has not yet peaked.\\nA cycle, not a collapse\\nWhile concerns about an AI bubble are valid, most experts agree that the technology\u2019s long-term impact is undeniable. As Cisco\u2019s Ben Dawson put it, every major technological transition goes through a cycle of hype, correction, and consolidation \u2014 but what remains afterward reshapes industries for decades.\\nFor now, the question isn\u2019t whether AI will endure, but how well businesses and investors can navigate the growing pains that come with every market bubble.\\n(Photo by Growtika)\\nSee also: NVIDIA GPUs to power Oracle\u2019s next-gen enterprise AI services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

It may even give you the confidence to approach someone else, too.\xa0\\nUniverse swag (and plenty of community stickers) are designed to help spark those natural, low-pressure conversations. And if you don\u2019t have any swag before the event, you can always visit The GitHub Shop and grab something day-of. We\u2019ll have a brand new GitHub Universe collection, so you\u2019ll be able to rep our latest and greatest.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Take it online with livestream or on-demand sessions\\nIf attending in-person still doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t forget that you can attend GitHub Universe virtually or catch keynotes and select session recordings later on-demand. Our goal: Make sure you can still participate and stay connected in a way that works best for you.\xa0\\nTo note: This might not always be an option at other tech conferences or events, but it\u2019s always worth checking to see if there are ways to learn and connect from home if that\u2019s your preferred method.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nWe hope you see you at GitHub Universe this year. Don\u2019t forget that however you plan to attend\u2014in-person, virtually, just a few workshops, or somewhere in between\u2014it\u2019s all in your control. Whether you\u2019re introverted (like us) or extroverted, or somewhere in between, we hope you have the best time!\xa0\\n[Register now]\\n\\n\\nThe post How to navigate GitHub Universe (or any tech conference) if you\u2019re an introvert appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"GitHub Staff","description":"<p>If alone time is your love language\u2014don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s ours too\u2014you can still attend, learn from, and enjoy big events like GitHub Universe.

It\u2019s part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\xa0\\nJetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity: Same Copilot, wherever you build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom instructions: Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGitHub MCP Server: Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkspace prompt files: Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20M+ developers strong: Every Copilot update compounds through the world\u2019s largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\\nCopilot isn\u2019t a separate tool you \u201cadd\u201d to GitHub. It\u2019s part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\\nSmarter, cleaner, and safer code \ud83d\udd0d\\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know). We\u2019ve spent a lot of cycles quietly leveling up Copilot\u2019s overall code quality and security guardrails where they matter most to you.\xa0\\nCopilot Autofix: Detects and patches vulnerabilities automatically (it was used to fix over a million vulnerabilities this year alone).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCode review: Summarizes diffs, flags logic bugs, and suggests fixes right inside your pull requests with a tool that powers millions of code reviews a month on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImproved model reasoning: Generates more readable, test-passing code with fewer lint errors and less regressions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL integration: Integrations with GitHub Advanced Security, Dependabot, and GitHub Actions keeps your supply chain solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilt-in privacy: Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant-level control mean your work stays off the grid.\xa0\\nOur research shows new code written with Copilot tends to have higher readability, better reliability, and improved maintainability scores.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s the good news: Copilot\u2019s backed by the same security stack that protects the world\u2019s largest open source ecosystem and more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal talk: Copilot vs. the rest \ud83d\udc40\\nLet\u2019s be honest: there are some great tools out there that make agentic coding workflows feel intuitive and bring real polish to multi-file editing.\xa0\\nCopilot lives in GitHub. That means it\u2019s close to everything else you do, whether it\u2019s your pull requests, GitHub Actions workflows, or CI/CD pipelines. Every day, GitHub powers over 3 million pull request merges and 50 million actions runs. And Copilot lives in that flow.\xa0\\nOther tools might help you write code faster. But Copilot helps you ship better software.\\nThat means:\xa0\\nNo migration, no new IDE, no new habits: Copilot lives inside the tools you already use.\xa0\\nFull-stack awareness: Your pull requests, reviews, tests, and workflows are part of the same conversation.\xa0\\nEnd-to-end coverage: Copilot brings AI assistance to real-world delivery.\xa0\\nWhat\u2019s next \ud83d\ude80\\nWe\u2019re just getting started.\\nAt the end of this month, GitHub Universe 2025 kicks off, and you can expect a lot of news. From smarter agent workflows to deeper multi-model integration and next-gen security features, we\u2019re building what\u2019s next for how software gets built.\\nBecause our goal hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re here to help every developer commit code faster instead of chasing TODOs.\xa0\\nReady to see how far we\u2019ve come?

Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here).

Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage. NASA FIRMS continued to detect active fires in Etosha up until Oct. 5. \\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features.

In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/globalsumudflotilla/p/DOXEm8viAZO/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">official statement</a> said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/DGGN1956/posts/812698534423606?ref=embed_post\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">National Guard on Facebook</a> stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZqrkLCnSl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">video</a> showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat.

No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXaR_MiOZ_/?igsh=YjdnaTEybGNocW94\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">recorded</a> from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast &#8211; the highest point on the vessel &#8211; before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"551\\" height=\\"987\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Gaza-flotilla-higher-colour-reduction-gif.gif\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49793\\"/></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Screencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat.

He can be seen <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXL9KhjJaK/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">in a video</a> from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXMeRaiq9t/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">said</a> in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Duarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXSL3jClWD/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">available</a> open sources documenting this strike.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"915\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49774\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg 1080w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-300x254.jpg 300w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-768x651.jpg 768w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Burned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions.
