Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\\n\\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\\n\\nBOTNETS R US\\nFerguson said he\u2019s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet\u2019s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\\n\u201cThe impact extends beyond victim networks,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast\u2019s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.\u201d\\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\\n\u201cThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,\u201d Dobbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.\u201d\\n\u201cThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,\u201d Dobbins continued. \u201cA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there\u2019s going to be a period ahead where there\u2019s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.\u201d\\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson\u2019s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from companies victimized by data theft.\\nU.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo \u2014 U.K. resident Thalha Jubair \u2014\xa0who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against Marks & Spencer and Harrods, the British food retailer Co-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions at MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.

But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it\u2019s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer\u2014an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-dxp-vision-and-the-role-of-wordpress\\">DXP vision and the role of WordPress</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It\u2019s not a single product; it\u2019s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends\u2014websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-decouple\\">Why decouple?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\\">Core Web Vitals</a> scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don\u2019t degrade the visitor experience.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints\u2014instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication\\">authentication</a>. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-speed-helps-security\\">How speed helps security</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior\u2014maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed\u2014it&#8217;s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-wordpress-aligns-with-security-first\\">Why WordPress aligns with security-first</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community\u2019s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-architecture-that-reduces-risks\\">Architecture that reduces risks</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-headless-decoupled-architecture\\">Headless/decoupled architecture</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/firewall\\">Firewall</a> (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.<a></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-network-and-edge-security\\">Network and edge security</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot\\">bot</a> management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits\u2014ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further secure our infrastructure, we have robust <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/ddos\\">DDoS</a> mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.<a></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day\\">HTTPS</a> connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-service-isolation-and-least-privilege\\">Service isolation and least privilege</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role\u2014nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-hardening-at-the-application-layer\\">Hardening at the application layer</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-secure-configuration\\">Secure configuration</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies\\">cookies</a> and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further reduce the platform\u2019s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality\u2014often abused for brute-force attacks\u2014and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits\\">exploit</a> to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-auth-and-session-security\\">Auth and session security</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it\u2019s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Access within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/cookie-hijacking\\">session hijacking</a> or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-data-handling\\">Data handling</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/sql-injection\\">SQL injection</a>, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii\\">personally identifiable information (PII)</a>, classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data\u2014supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-plugin-and-supply-chain-governance\\">Plugin and supply chain governance</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-controlled-ecosystem\\">Controlled ecosystem</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of \u201cmust-use\u201d (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform\u2019s foundational layers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-dependency-management\\">Dependency management</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-vulnerability-intelligence-and-patching\\">Vulnerability intelligence and patching</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity\u2014ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we\u2019re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-infrastructure-security-operations\\">Infrastructure security operations</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-secrets-and-data\\">Secrets and data</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers. Where supported, our databases rely on IAM-based authentication instead of static credentials, further minimizing the risk associated with traditional username-password pairs. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-backups-and-disaster-recovery\\">Backups and disaster recovery</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, or <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware\\">ransomware</a> attacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly. Explicit Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are defined, routinely tested, and adjusted as needed to meet the demands of our operations and regulatory obligations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data recovery playbooks are meticulously maintained and encompass every critical aspect of our environment, from core content and media to infrastructure-as-code templates that can quickly and predictably rebuild our systems. These playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for recovering data and restoring services, whether in response to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a targeted attack. By rigorously documenting and testing these processes, we ensure a high degree of resilience and confidence in our ability to restore normal operations with minimal disruption, safeguarding both our assets and the experience of our users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-observability-and-response\\">Observability and response</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We maintain a comprehensive observability stack with centralized, structured logging that aggregates data from all key layers\u2014Nginx, PHP-FPM, WordPress, and supporting services. This logging is enriched with real-time metrics and distributed traces, giving us end-to-end visibility into application performance and user activity across our digital experience platform (DXP). All logs are funneled into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which acts as the nerve center for detecting and investigating potential threats. Hosts and containers are further protected by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, providing continuous monitoring and the ability to quickly isolate and remediate suspicious behavior.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To enhance detection and incident response, we employ automated anomaly detection and maintain detailed runbooks, dramatically reducing our mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to issues. Our security posture is continually tested and validated through regular penetration tests and an active bug bounty program that focus on the entire surface of our DXP, not just on isolated components. This holistic approach ensures we proactively identify vulnerabilities, address weaknesses before they can be exploited, and ultimately maintain a resilient, trustworthy platform for our users and customers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-certifications-obtained\\">Certifications Obtained</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to building or selecting hosting for your organization\u2019s sensitive data and mission-critical applications, certifications matter\u2014a lot. Obtaining FedRAMP Moderate certified ensures compliance with rigorous federal security standards, making it a necessity for government-related workloads and a great standard for any organization to abide. Similarly, a SOC 2 Type 1 certification demonstrates that a hosting provider has established robust systems and controls to protect data and ensure privacy, fostering client trust and accountability.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>GovRAMP Moderate is critical for U.S. government contractors working with state and local government workloads, ensuring additional layers of compliance and security. If your data processing touches on European clients or users, GDPR and the Data Privacy Framework offer reassurance that personal data is handled and processed lawfully, transparently, and securely. Equally important is the Microsoft SSPA, a must-have for vendors providing services to Microsoft or handling its data. Lastly, WCAG 2.0 AA compliance ensures that your hosted applications and websites are accessible to users and employees with disabilities, strengthening your commitment to inclusivity and expanding your reach. By prioritizing these certifications, organizations not only safeguard compliance and security, but also demonstrate a dedication to transparency, privacy, and accessibility in today\u2019s digital landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-editorial-workflow-governance\\">Editorial workflow governance</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-workflow-controls\\">Workflow controls</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every administrative and content-related event is thoroughly audit-logged, capturing a detailed trail of actions for review and oversight. These logs are fully exportable, supporting compliance with regulatory requirements and internal governance policies. By maintaining comprehensive and accessible audit records, we provide the transparency necessary to facilitate investigations, enforce accountability, and demonstrate adherence to best practices and legal obligations\u2014ensuring peace of mind for our organization and stakeholders alike.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-secure-content-operations\\">Secure content operations</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We prioritize security awareness by providing editors with ongoing training on critical topics, such as <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing\\">phishing</a> recognition, safe link practices, and our governance policies for embedded scripts and third-party widgets. This continual education helps staff identify and avoid <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering\\">social engineering attacks</a>, understand the risks associated with external content, and adhere to protocols that maintain the integrity and security of our web platform. By empowering editors with the knowledge to make secure decisions, we reduce the likelihood of errors that could compromise the site or expose sensitive information.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further protect user interactions, especially on forms, we deploy layered anti-spam defenses, implement bot challenges like CAPTCHAs, and set server-side rate limits to prevent abuse. All form inputs are validated on the server, ensuring robust protection even if client-side checks are bypassed or disabled. This disciplined approach to input handling and abuse prevention ensures our forms remain a secure channel for legitimate user engagement while blocking malicious actors and automated attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-reliable-and-secure-performance\\">Reliable and secure performance</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-caching-strategy\\">Caching strategy</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our performance strategy centers on comprehensive caching and efficient data handling to deliver a fast, reliable experience for both users and administrators. Edge and page-level caching shield our origin servers by intercepting and serving frequent requests directly at the edge, dramatically reducing the number of dynamic requests that reach the core infrastructure. Object caching solutions like Redis, coupled with thoughtfully optimized queries, keep the admin interface responsive and ensure APIs remain quick even under load. We routinely profile database queries and set strict performance budgets for the slowest paths, preventing regressions that could degrade performance or escalate into broader availability issues. This layered approach ensures our platform stays speedy, stable, and scalable as demands grow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-build-pipeline\\">Build pipeline</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every code change in our workflow is subjected to automated testing, with comprehensive suites that verify functionality, performance, and security. Security gates are tightly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that no changes are merged if any issues or vulnerabilities are detected. Our deployment processes are fully automated and repeatable, significantly reducing the potential for human error and guaranteeing that releases are consistent, predictable, and recoverable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By managing our infrastructure as code, we further ensure that all environments\u2014from development to production\u2014are consistent, auditable, and easily reproducible. This approach not only accelerates the provisioning of resources and the rollout of updates, but also strengthens compliance and traceability, providing a solid foundation for scalability, reliability, and continuous improvement.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-ux-and-seo\\">UX and SEO</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We finely tune our security headers and Content Security Policies (CSPs) to deliver robust protection without disrupting the user experience, ensuring that all site functionality remains seamless and accessible. Our commitment to performance extends to advanced image optimization, responsive asset delivery, and strict adherence to accessibility standards, enabling our content to load quickly and be usable by everyone. By consistently delivering fast, accessible pages, we not only enhance user engagement but also enable rapid, safe deployment cycles\u2014minimizing potential attack windows through swift rollouts and efficient rollbacks, and maintaining both security and usability at the core of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-alternatives-considered\\">Alternatives considered</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Proprietary Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) present a compelling all-in-one suite of features that can streamline operations for many organizations. However, their advantages often come with trade-offs: these platforms tend to be resource intensive, both in terms of infrastructure and licensing fees, and may lack the granular transparency required for deep security audits or targeted customizations. The inherent complexity and tightly-coupled nature of these solutions can slow the pace of change\u2014making it challenging to adapt or patch emergent threats rapidly, which is itself a significant security and business risk in dynamic environments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Headless-only SaaS CMSes, on the other hand, are designed for flexibility and API excellence, offering developers modern tooling and a frictionless integration experience. Despite these strengths, organizations may encounter challenges such as vendor lock-in, which can limit strategic choices and agility over time. Control over patching and updates is usually in the hands of the SaaS provider, potentially creating gaps between issue discovery and remediation. Further, these platforms may present hurdles in regions with strict data residency or compliance requirements, making them less suitable for regulated industries or global enterprises with nuanced jurisdictional needs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Systems like Drupal or fully-custom CMS architectures can undoubtably satisfy enterprise requirements for scale, extensibility, and security. However, in our evaluation, team expertise, the maturity and momentum of the adjacent tooling ecosystem, and a clear view of total cost of ownership all ultimately favored the adoption of WordPress. WordPress\u2019s balance of flexibility, a wealth of existing integrations, well-understood operational paradigms, and strong community support enables us to deliver on our goals efficiently while ensuring we maintain the adaptability, security, and cost-effectiveness our organization requires.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>WordPress provides the best mix of transparency, control, ecosystem breadth, and speed\u2014when paired with our security architecture and operating model.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-lessons-learned-and-best-practices\\">Lessons learned and best practices</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>Start headless and isolate the admin plane from day one.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Enforce SSO and MFA, least privilege roles, and formal change approval.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Treat plugins as third-party code: audit, monitor, and patch under SLAs.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Invest in observability and rehearse incident response regularly.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>Keep WordPress core close to vanilla; extend through vetted plugins and mu-plugins, not core forks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security is not a property of a tool; it\u2019s the outcome of architecture, governance, and culture.

WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.\\nDXP vision and the role of WordPress\\nWhen we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It\u2019s not a single product; it\u2019s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.\\nIn that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends\u2014websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.\\nWhy decouple?\\nBy delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in Core Web Vitals scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don\u2019t degrade the visitor experience.\\nSecurity isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints\u2014instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and authentication. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.\\nThis architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.\\nHow speed helps security\\nRapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior\u2014maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.\\nShortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed\u2014it\u2019s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.\\nWhy WordPress aligns with security-first\\nOpen-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community\u2019s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.\\nThe core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.\\nFinally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.\\nArchitecture that reduces risks\\nHeadless/decoupled architecture\\nOur public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.\\nTo further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.\\nNetwork and edge security\\nOur Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced bot management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits\u2014ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.\\nTo further secure our infrastructure, we have robust DDoS mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.\\nWe enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure HTTPS connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.\\nService isolation and least privilege\\nOur security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role\u2014nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.\\nHardening at the application layer\\nSecure configuration\\nIn our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication cookies and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.\\nTo further reduce the platform\u2019s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality\u2014often abused for brute-force attacks\u2014and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may exploit to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.\\nAuth and session security\\nWe integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it\u2019s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.\\nAccess within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for session hijacking or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.\\nData handling\\nSecurity is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against SQL injection, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.\\nData privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of personally identifiable information (PII), classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data\u2014supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.\\nPlugin and supply chain governance\\nControlled ecosystem\\nOur approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of \u201cmust-use\u201d (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform\u2019s foundational layers.\\nBefore any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.\\nDependency management\\nWe take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.\\nOur CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.\\nVulnerability intelligence and patching\\nWe actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity\u2014ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.\\nIn the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we\u2019re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.\\nInfrastructure security operations\\nSecrets and data\\nWe enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.\\nAll data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers. Where supported, our databases rely on IAM-based authentication instead of static credentials, further minimizing the risk associated with traditional username-password pairs. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.\\nBackups and disaster recovery\\nOur disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, or ransomware attacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly. Explicit Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are defined, routinely tested, and adjusted as needed to meet the demands of our operations and regulatory obligations.\\nData recovery playbooks are meticulously maintained and encompass every critical aspect of our environment, from core content and media to infrastructure-as-code templates that can quickly and predictably rebuild our systems. These playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for recovering data and restoring services, whether in response to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a targeted attack. By rigorously documenting and testing these processes, we ensure a high degree of resilience and confidence in our ability to restore normal operations with minimal disruption, safeguarding both our assets and the experience of our users.\\nObservability and response\\nWe maintain a comprehensive observability stack with centralized, structured logging that aggregates data from all key layers\u2014Nginx, PHP-FPM, WordPress, and supporting services. This logging is enriched with real-time metrics and distributed traces, giving us end-to-end visibility into application performance and user activity across our digital experience platform (DXP). All logs are funneled into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which acts as the nerve center for detecting and investigating potential threats. Hosts and containers are further protected by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, providing continuous monitoring and the ability to quickly isolate and remediate suspicious behavior.\\nTo enhance detection and incident response, we employ automated anomaly detection and maintain detailed runbooks, dramatically reducing our mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to issues. Our security posture is continually tested and validated through regular penetration tests and an active bug bounty program that focus on the entire surface of our DXP, not just on isolated components. This holistic approach ensures we proactively identify vulnerabilities, address weaknesses before they can be exploited, and ultimately maintain a resilient, trustworthy platform for our users and customers.\\nCertifications Obtained\\nWhen it comes to building or selecting hosting for your organization\u2019s sensitive data and mission-critical applications, certifications matter\u2014a lot. Obtaining FedRAMP Moderate certified ensures compliance with rigorous federal security standards, making it a necessity for government-related workloads and a great standard for any organization to abide. Similarly, a SOC 2 Type 1 certification demonstrates that a hosting provider has established robust systems and controls to protect data and ensure privacy, fostering client trust and accountability.\\nGovRAMP Moderate is critical for U.S. government contractors working with state and local government workloads, ensuring additional layers of compliance and security. If your data processing touches on European clients or users, GDPR and the Data Privacy Framework offer reassurance that personal data is handled and processed lawfully, transparently, and securely. Equally important is the Microsoft SSPA, a must-have for vendors providing services to Microsoft or handling its data. Lastly, WCAG 2.0 AA compliance ensures that your hosted applications and websites are accessible to users and employees with disabilities, strengthening your commitment to inclusivity and expanding your reach. By prioritizing these certifications, organizations not only safeguard compliance and security, but also demonstrate a dedication to transparency, privacy, and accessibility in today\u2019s digital landscape.\\nEditorial workflow governance\\nWorkflow controls\\nEvery administrative and content-related event is thoroughly audit-logged, capturing a detailed trail of actions for review and oversight. These logs are fully exportable, supporting compliance with regulatory requirements and internal governance policies. By maintaining comprehensive and accessible audit records, we provide the transparency necessary to facilitate investigations, enforce accountability, and demonstrate adherence to best practices and legal obligations\u2014ensuring peace of mind for our organization and stakeholders alike.\\nSecure content operations\\nWe prioritize security awareness by providing editors with ongoing training on critical topics, such as phishing recognition, safe link practices, and our governance policies for embedded scripts and third-party widgets. This continual education helps staff identify and avoid social engineering attacks, understand the risks associated with external content, and adhere to protocols that maintain the integrity and security of our web platform. By empowering editors with the knowledge to make secure decisions, we reduce the likelihood of errors that could compromise the site or expose sensitive information.\\nTo further protect user interactions, especially on forms, we deploy layered anti-spam defenses, implement bot challenges like CAPTCHAs, and set server-side rate limits to prevent abuse. All form inputs are validated on the server, ensuring robust protection even if client-side checks are bypassed or disabled. This disciplined approach to input handling and abuse prevention ensures our forms remain a secure channel for legitimate user engagement while blocking malicious actors and automated attacks.\\nReliable and secure performance\\nCaching strategy\\nOur performance strategy centers on comprehensive caching and efficient data handling to deliver a fast, reliable experience for both users and administrators. Edge and page-level caching shield our origin servers by intercepting and serving frequent requests directly at the edge, dramatically reducing the number of dynamic requests that reach the core infrastructure. Object caching solutions like Redis, coupled with thoughtfully optimized queries, keep the admin interface responsive and ensure APIs remain quick even under load. We routinely profile database queries and set strict performance budgets for the slowest paths, preventing regressions that could degrade performance or escalate into broader availability issues. This layered approach ensures our platform stays speedy, stable, and scalable as demands grow.\\nBuild pipeline\\nEvery code change in our workflow is subjected to automated testing, with comprehensive suites that verify functionality, performance, and security. Security gates are tightly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that no changes are merged if any issues or vulnerabilities are detected. Our deployment processes are fully automated and repeatable, significantly reducing the potential for human error and guaranteeing that releases are consistent, predictable, and recoverable.\\nBy managing our infrastructure as code, we further ensure that all environments\u2014from development to production\u2014are consistent, auditable, and easily reproducible. This approach not only accelerates the provisioning of resources and the rollout of updates, but also strengthens compliance and traceability, providing a solid foundation for scalability, reliability, and continuous improvement.\\nUX and SEO\\nWe finely tune our security headers and Content Security Policies (CSPs) to deliver robust protection without disrupting the user experience, ensuring that all site functionality remains seamless and accessible. Our commitment to performance extends to advanced image optimization, responsive asset delivery, and strict adherence to accessibility standards, enabling our content to load quickly and be usable by everyone. By consistently delivering fast, accessible pages, we not only enhance user engagement but also enable rapid, safe deployment cycles\u2014minimizing potential attack windows through swift rollouts and efficient rollbacks, and maintaining both security and usability at the core of our platform.\\nAlternatives considered\\nProprietary Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) present a compelling all-in-one suite of features that can streamline operations for many organizations. However, their advantages often come with trade-offs: these platforms tend to be resource intensive, both in terms of infrastructure and licensing fees, and may lack the granular transparency required for deep security audits or targeted customizations. The inherent complexity and tightly-coupled nature of these solutions can slow the pace of change\u2014making it challenging to adapt or patch emergent threats rapidly, which is itself a significant security and business risk in dynamic environments.\\nHeadless-only SaaS CMSes, on the other hand, are designed for flexibility and API excellence, offering developers modern tooling and a frictionless integration experience. Despite these strengths, organizations may encounter challenges such as vendor lock-in, which can limit strategic choices and agility over time. Control over patching and updates is usually in the hands of the SaaS provider, potentially creating gaps between issue discovery and remediation. Further, these platforms may present hurdles in regions with strict data residency or compliance requirements, making them less suitable for regulated industries or global enterprises with nuanced jurisdictional needs.\\nSystems like Drupal or fully-custom CMS architectures can undoubtably satisfy enterprise requirements for scale, extensibility, and security. However, in our evaluation, team expertise, the maturity and momentum of the adjacent tooling ecosystem, and a clear view of total cost of ownership all ultimately favored the adoption of WordPress. WordPress\u2019s balance of flexibility, a wealth of existing integrations, well-understood operational paradigms, and strong community support enables us to deliver on our goals efficiently while ensuring we maintain the adaptability, security, and cost-effectiveness our organization requires.\\nWordPress provides the best mix of transparency, control, ecosystem breadth, and speed\u2014when paired with our security architecture and operating model.\\nLessons learned and best practices\\nStart headless and isolate the admin plane from day one.\\nEnforce SSO and MFA, least privilege roles, and formal change approval.\\nTreat plugins as third-party code: audit, monitor, and patch under SLAs.\\nInvest in observability and rehearse incident response regularly.\\nKeep WordPress core close to vanilla; extend through vetted plugins and mu-plugins, not core forks.\\nSecurity is not a property of a tool; it\u2019s the outcome of architecture, governance, and culture. With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP\u2014combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.","description":" It might surprise some that a security company would choose WordPress as the backbone of its digital content operations.

However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS.

Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

(Credit: Mauricioro Morales/Al Jazeera; Airman 1st Class Brooke Moeder/DVIDS; Israel Police)\\nBellingcat showed the images and footage to munitions expert Dr N.R. Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions. For example, the Ukraine-Russia war has led to many videos of drones with attached thermite or other incendiary munitions burning as they fly over enemy positions. Similar incendiary munitions have also been used in Gaza. All these burn in a manner consistent with the incendiary munitions used in the attacks on the Family Boat and Alma.\\n\\nScreencaptures from attacks on the Family Boat, Alma and incendiary munition attacks in Gaza.

It was also tested on data from whole exome sequencing (WES), a more affordable method that sequences only the 1% of the genome coding for proteins. In both scenarios, DeepSomatic outperformed other tools, suggesting its utility for analysing lower-quality or historical samples.\\nAn AI tool for all cancers\\nThe AI tool has shown it can apply its learning to new cancer types it wasn\u2019t trained on. When used to analyse a glioblastoma sample, an aggressive brain cancer, it successfully pinpointed the few variants known to drive the disease. In a partnership with Children\u2019s Mercy in Kansas City, it analysed eight samples of paediatric leukaemia and found the previously known variants while identifying 10 new ones, despite working with tumour-only samples.\\nGoogle hopes research labs and clinicians will adopt this tool to better understand individual tumours. By detecting known cancer variants, it could help guide choices for existing treatments. By identifying new ones, it could lead to new therapies. The goal is to advance precision medicine and deliver more effective treatments to patients.\\nSee also: MHRA fast-tracks next wave of AI tools for patient care\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.\\nBuilding long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears\\nWhen asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.\\nRather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn\u2019t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what\u2019s coming.\\nMiceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,\u201d he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.\\nDifferent shades of caution\\nAcross the industry, opinions vary on whether AI\u2019s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.\\nAccording to Reuters, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore\u2019s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding \u201chuge multiples\u201d despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.\\nJeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones \u2014 though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.\\nAt Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable. He said the long-term case for AI investment is strong, but the ultimate winners are still uncertain given how quickly technology changes and how easily companies can switch providers.\\nMeanwhile, ABB CEO Morten Wierod told Reuters that while he doesn\u2019t see an AI bubble, supply chain and construction limits could slow the rollout of new data centres. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas added that even if there\u2019s a downturn, it\u2019s unlikely to cause a systemic financial crisis since AI investments aren\u2019t debt-driven.\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman also acknowledged market overexcitement, predicting that some investors will lose large sums while others will profit heavily \u2014 an outcome that mirrors past technology bubbles.\\nDespite growing talk of an AI bubble, many investors remain committed to the sector. UBS equity strategists said that about 90% of investors who think the market is overheated are still holding AI-related assets, suggesting most believe the industry has not yet peaked.\\nA cycle, not a collapse\\nWhile concerns about an AI bubble are valid, most experts agree that the technology\u2019s long-term impact is undeniable. As Cisco\u2019s Ben Dawson put it, every major technological transition goes through a cycle of hype, correction, and consolidation \u2014 but what remains afterward reshapes industries for decades.\\nFor now, the question isn\u2019t whether AI will endure, but how well businesses and investors can navigate the growing pains that come with every market bubble.\\n(Photo by Growtika)\\nSee also: NVIDIA GPUs to power Oracle\u2019s next-gen enterprise AI services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Below you\u2019ll find the projects and the three major themes we\u2019re seeing across their work.\\nFramework and platform integrations: Ecosystem integrations for real-world use cases \xa0\\nThese projects integrate bring MCP capabilities into popular frameworks and ecosystems for AI-native tooling and help MCP with widely used platforms, and enable agents to interact with real-world apps and workflows:\xa0\\nfastapi_mcp: Expose secure FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools with minimal setup, authentication, and limited configuration\u2014all with a unified infrastructure.\xa0\\nnuxt-mcp: Nuxt developer tools for route inspection and SSR debugging make it easier for your team to make models understand your Vite/Nuxt app better.\xa0\\nunity-mcp: Unity MCP allows you to interface with game engine APIs for AI-assisted game development and gives your AI tools to manage assets, control scenes, edit scripts, and automate tasks within Unity\xa0\\nDeveloper experience and AI-enhanced coding: AI-first developer productivity \xa0\\nThese projects empower AI,\xa0 LLMs and agents to act as intelligent IDE assistants and code editors by improving developer workflows, semantic code understanding, and safe code execution.\\ncontext7: Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from your code and plugs them directly into your AI and LLM prompts LLM\u2019s context.\xa0\xa0\\nserena: Semantic code editing and retrieval for agent-driven coding agent toolkit providing semantic retrieval and editing capabilities.\xa0\xa0\\nPeekaboo: Swift code analysis that turns what\u2019s on your screen into actionable AI context to create full GUI automation, and can be used for AI assistants.\xa0\xa0\\ncoderunner: Coderunner turns LLMs into an instant, local execution partner that writes and runs code in a preconfigured sandbox on your machine, auto-installs tools, directly reads files, and returns outputs and generated artifacts.\xa0\\nAutomation, testing and orchestration: Reliability and quality assurance for MCP infrastructure\xa0\\nThese projects help extend MCP infrastructure into production grade tools for automation pipelines and providing robust testing, and debugging tools. These help ensure you can run MCP at scale.\xa0\\n\xa0MCP server evaluation:\xa0\\nn8n-mcp: n8n-MCP is an ultra-optimized platform that enhances n8n\u2019s workflow automation by streamlining workflow creation and orchestration. It integrates AI models to help users better understand and work with n8n nodes.\\ninspector: A tool for testing and debugging MCP servers by inspecting protocol handshake, tools, resources, prompts, and OAuth flows. It offers a built-in LLM playground and lets you run eval simulations to catch security or performance regressions.\xa0\xa0\\nAI workflows and agentic developer productivity with MCP and open source\xa0\\nDevelopers are building at incredible speed with the power of AI and MCP. These projects represent some of the fastest growing developer tools within the MCP ecosystem and community. They are tools that developers use and care about. GitHub Copilot and VS Code teams are excited to sponsor more open source projects that drive new innovations like MCP for agent-native development.\xa0\\nSign up for GitHub Sponsors today to join us in sponsoring these projects (and more!) and help support the MCP ecosystem.

Julia explained it this way: \u201cEverything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.\u201d\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: COBOL\u2019s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid chart example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality check: It\u2019s not a silver bullet\\nJulia\u2019s brutally honest about limitations:\\nEveryone who\u2019s currently promising you, \u2018hey, I can solve all your mainframe problems with just one click\u2019 is lying to you.\\nThe reality is:\\nHumans must stay in the loop for validation.\\nEach COBOL codebase is unique and complex.\\nWe\u2019re early in the agentic AI journey.\\nFull automation is probably at least five years away.\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make massive progress today.\\nSee it in action: the Azure samples framework\\nJulia and her team have open-sourced their entire framework. It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt. It\u2019s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.\\nThe traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that\u2019s unmaintainable. I\u2019ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don\u2019t understand in a language they\u2019re still learning.\\nThe AI-powered approach changes this. You use AI to understand business logic, generate human-readable modern code, and maintain control of your intellectual property. Your team stays involved throughout the process. They learn the business logic as they go. The code that comes out the other end is something your developers can actually work with.\\nJulia explained the shift:\\nWhat a lot of customers do not want to actually give all their intellectual property like a hundred percent to a partner anymore, right? They want to keep it in check.\\nStart here: your path to becoming the modernization hero\\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with COBOL, ancient Java, or any legacy system, here\u2019s how you can start today:\\nStart small\\nIdentify one problematic legacy system (start with fewer than 5,000 lines)\\nUse GitHub Copilot to analyze a single file\\nDocument what you discover in markdown\\nShare findings with your team\\nBuild your AI toolkit\\nExperiment with the Azure Samples framework\\nLearn prompt engineering for code analysis (try: \u201cAnalyze this COBOL program and explain its business purpose in simple terms\u201d)\\nPractice iterative modernization techniques\\nThink beyond code\\nConsider nonfunctional requirements for cloud-native design\\nPlan for distributed systems architecture\\nRemember: most COBOL programs are doing simple CRUD operations. They don\u2019t need the complexity of a mainframe. They need the simplicity of modern architecture.\\nHere\u2019s a challenge: Find a legacy system in your organization. Six-month-old code counts as legacy in our industry. Try using GitHub Copilot to:\\nGenerate business logic documentation\\nIdentify potential modernization opportunities\\nCreate a migration plan with human validation checkpoints\\nShare your results on LinkedIn and tag me. I\u2019d love to see what you discover.\\nThe best time to start is now\\nThe most powerful insight from my conversation with Julia is this: AI doesn\u2019t replace developer expertise. It amplifies it.\\nCOBOL experts bring irreplaceable domain knowledge. Modern developers bring fresh perspectives on architecture and best practices. AI brings pattern recognition and translation capabilities at scale.\\nWhen these three forces work together, legacy modernization transforms from an impossible challenge into an achievable project.\\nThe best time to modernize legacy code was 10 years ago. The second-best time is now.\\nSpecial thanks to Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who shared her insights and experiences that made this blog post possible.\\nReady to dive deeper? Check out the full blog post about this project at aka.ms/cobol-blog and connect with Julia on LinkedIn for the latest updates.\\nThe age of legacy code doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier anymore. With the right AI tools and framework, even 65-year-old COBOL can become approachable, maintainable, and modern.\\nWhat legacy system will you modernize next?

After all, WordPress is often associated with open-source plugins, community themes, and a wide range of deployment practices\u2014some stronger than others. But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it\u2019s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer\u2014an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-dxp-vision-and-the-role-of-wordpress\\">DXP vision and the role of WordPress</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It\u2019s not a single product; it\u2019s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends\u2014websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-decouple\\">Why decouple?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\\">Core Web Vitals</a> scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don\u2019t degrade the visitor experience.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints\u2014instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication\\">authentication</a>. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-speed-helps-security\\">How speed helps security</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior\u2014maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed\u2014it&#8217;s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-wordpress-aligns-with-security-first\\">Why WordPress aligns with security-first</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community\u2019s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-architecture-that-reduces-risks\\">Architecture that reduces risks</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-headless-decoupled-architecture\\">Headless/decoupled architecture</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/firewall\\">Firewall</a> (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.<a></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-network-and-edge-security\\">Network and edge security</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot\\">bot</a> management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits\u2014ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further secure our infrastructure, we have robust <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/ddos\\">DDoS</a> mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.<a></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day\\">HTTPS</a> connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-service-isolation-and-least-privilege\\">Service isolation and least privilege</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role\u2014nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-hardening-at-the-application-layer\\">Hardening at the application layer</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-secure-configuration\\">Secure configuration</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies\\">cookies</a> and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further reduce the platform\u2019s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality\u2014often abused for brute-force attacks\u2014and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits\\">exploit</a> to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-auth-and-session-security\\">Auth and session security</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it\u2019s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Access within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/cookie-hijacking\\">session hijacking</a> or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-data-handling\\">Data handling</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/sql-injection\\">SQL injection</a>, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii\\">personally identifiable information (PII)</a>, classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data\u2014supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-plugin-and-supply-chain-governance\\">Plugin and supply chain governance</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-controlled-ecosystem\\">Controlled ecosystem</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of \u201cmust-use\u201d (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform\u2019s foundational layers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-dependency-management\\">Dependency management</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-vulnerability-intelligence-and-patching\\">Vulnerability intelligence and patching</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity\u2014ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we\u2019re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-infrastructure-security-operations\\">Infrastructure security operations</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-secrets-and-data\\">Secrets and data</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers. Where supported, our databases rely on IAM-based authentication instead of static credentials, further minimizing the risk associated with traditional username-password pairs. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-backups-and-disaster-recovery\\">Backups and disaster recovery</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, or <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware\\">ransomware</a> attacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly.

With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP\u2014combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.</p>\\n","content:encodedSnippet":"It might surprise some that a security company would choose WordPress as the backbone of its digital content operations. After all, WordPress is often associated with open-source plugins, community themes, and a wide range of deployment practices\u2014some stronger than others. But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it\u2019s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer\u2014an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.\\nThe reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.\\nDXP vision and the role of WordPress\\nWhen we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It\u2019s not a single product; it\u2019s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.\\nIn that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends\u2014websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.\\nWhy decouple?\\nBy delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in Core Web Vitals scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don\u2019t degrade the visitor experience.\\nSecurity isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints\u2014instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and authentication. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.\\nThis architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.\\nHow speed helps security\\nRapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior\u2014maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.\\nShortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed\u2014it\u2019s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.\\nWhy WordPress aligns with security-first\\nOpen-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community\u2019s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.\\nThe core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.\\nFinally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.\\nArchitecture that reduces risks\\nHeadless/decoupled architecture\\nOur public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.\\nTo further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.\\nNetwork and edge security\\nOur Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced bot management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits\u2014ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.\\nTo further secure our infrastructure, we have robust DDoS mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.\\nWe enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure HTTPS connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.\\nService isolation and least privilege\\nOur security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role\u2014nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.\\nHardening at the application layer\\nSecure configuration\\nIn our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication cookies and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.\\nTo further reduce the platform\u2019s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality\u2014often abused for brute-force attacks\u2014and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may exploit to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.\\nAuth and session security\\nWe integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it\u2019s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.\\nAccess within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for session hijacking or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.\\nData handling\\nSecurity is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against SQL injection, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.\\nData privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of personally identifiable information (PII), classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data\u2014supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.\\nPlugin and supply chain governance\\nControlled ecosystem\\nOur approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of \u201cmust-use\u201d (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform\u2019s foundational layers.\\nBefore any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.\\nDependency management\\nWe take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.\\nOur CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.\\nVulnerability intelligence and patching\\nWe actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity\u2014ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.\\nIn the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we\u2019re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.\\nInfrastructure security operations\\nSecrets and data\\nWe enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.\\nAll data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers. Where supported, our databases rely on IAM-based authentication instead of static credentials, further minimizing the risk associated with traditional username-password pairs. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.\\nBackups and disaster recovery\\nOur disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, or ransomware attacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly. Explicit Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are defined, routinely tested, and adjusted as needed to meet the demands of our operations and regulatory obligations.\\nData recovery playbooks are meticulously maintained and encompass every critical aspect of our environment, from core content and media to infrastructure-as-code templates that can quickly and predictably rebuild our systems. These playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for recovering data and restoring services, whether in response to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a targeted attack. By rigorously documenting and testing these processes, we ensure a high degree of resilience and confidence in our ability to restore normal operations with minimal disruption, safeguarding both our assets and the experience of our users.\\nObservability and response\\nWe maintain a comprehensive observability stack with centralized, structured logging that aggregates data from all key layers\u2014Nginx, PHP-FPM, WordPress, and supporting services. This logging is enriched with real-time metrics and distributed traces, giving us end-to-end visibility into application performance and user activity across our digital experience platform (DXP). All logs are funneled into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which acts as the nerve center for detecting and investigating potential threats. Hosts and containers are further protected by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, providing continuous monitoring and the ability to quickly isolate and remediate suspicious behavior.\\nTo enhance detection and incident response, we employ automated anomaly detection and maintain detailed runbooks, dramatically reducing our mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to issues. Our security posture is continually tested and validated through regular penetration tests and an active bug bounty program that focus on the entire surface of our DXP, not just on isolated components. This holistic approach ensures we proactively identify vulnerabilities, address weaknesses before they can be exploited, and ultimately maintain a resilient, trustworthy platform for our users and customers.\\nCertifications Obtained\\nWhen it comes to building or selecting hosting for your organization\u2019s sensitive data and mission-critical applications, certifications matter\u2014a lot. Obtaining FedRAMP Moderate certified ensures compliance with rigorous federal security standards, making it a necessity for government-related workloads and a great standard for any organization to abide.

WordPress\u2019s balance of flexibility, a wealth of existing integrations, well-understood operational paradigms, and strong community support enables us to deliver on our goals efficiently while ensuring we maintain the adaptability, security, and cost-effectiveness our organization requires.\\nWordPress provides the best mix of transparency, control, ecosystem breadth, and speed\u2014when paired with our security architecture and operating model.\\nLessons learned and best practices\\nStart headless and isolate the admin plane from day one.\\nEnforce SSO and MFA, least privilege roles, and formal change approval.\\nTreat plugins as third-party code: audit, monitor, and patch under SLAs.\\nInvest in observability and rehearse incident response regularly.\\nKeep WordPress core close to vanilla; extend through vetted plugins and mu-plugins, not core forks.\\nSecurity is not a property of a tool; it\u2019s the outcome of architecture, governance, and culture. With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP\u2014combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.","description":" It might surprise some that a security company would choose WordPress as the backbone of its digital content operations.

This includes $100,000 for a complete Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access, as no successful exploit has been demonstrated to date in either category.\\nOur bounty categories are expanding to cover even more attack surfaces. Notably, we\u2019re rewarding one-click WebKit sandbox escapes with up to $300,000, and wireless proximity exploits over any radio with up to $1 million.\\nWe\u2019re introducing Target Flags, a new way for researchers to objectively demonstrate exploitability for some of our top bounty categories, including remote code execution and Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) bypasses \xad and to help determine eligibility for a specific award. Researchers who submit reports with Target Flags will qualify for accelerated awards, which are processed immediately after the research is received and verified, even before a fix becomes available.","id":"https://www.schneier.com/?p=70981","isoDate":"2025-10-15T11:02:18.000Z","feedKey":"schneier-security","feedTitle":"Schneier on Security","category":"cyber","cleanTitle":"Apple\u2019s Bug Bounty Program","publishedDate":"2025-10-15T11:02:18.000Z"},{"creator":"BrianKrebs","title":"Patch Tuesday, October 2025 \u2018End of 10\u2019 Edition","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/patch-tuesday-october-2025-end-of-10-edition/","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Oct 2025 22:57:38 +0000","content:encoded":"<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released software updates to plug a whopping 172 security holes in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems, including at least two vulnerabilities that are already being actively exploited.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72353\\" style=\\"width: 753px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72353\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"743\\" height=\\"93\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72353\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet.

Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide.

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet\u2019s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru\u2019s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\\nAs Aisuru\u2019s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google\u2019s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru\u2019s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\\n\\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s overlords aren\u2019t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet\u2019s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\\n\u201cThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,\u201d he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\\n\\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28\xa0 can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic.

XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from companies victimized by data theft.\\nU.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo \u2014 U.K. resident Thalha Jubair \u2014\xa0who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against Marks & Spencer and Harrods, the British food retailer Co-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions at MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.\\n\\nA Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Teenagers.\u201d\\n\\nIn August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida man Noah Michael Urban was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.\\nIn April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member was extradited from Spain to the U.S., where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allege\xa0Tyler Robert Buchanan\xa0and co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims.\\nUpdate, Oct. 8, 8:59 a.m. ET: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the malware sent by the reader as a Windows screenshot file. Rather, it is a Windows screensaver file.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/#comments","description":"A cybercriminal group that used voice phishing attacks to siphon more than a billion records from Salesforce customers earlier this year has launched a website that threatens to publish data stolen from dozens of Fortune 500 firms if they refuse to pay a ransom.

But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day.

Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features. Circle annotations by Bellingcat.\\nBands \u2018A Major Cause For Concern\u2019\\nThe Active Club event was more than just a \u201cfight night\u201d. In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right).

They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions. For example, the Ukraine-Russia war has led to many videos of drones with attached thermite or other incendiary munitions burning as they fly over enemy positions. Similar incendiary munitions have also been used in Gaza. All these burn in a manner consistent with the incendiary munitions used in the attacks on the Family Boat and Alma.\\n\\nScreencaptures from attacks on the Family Boat, Alma and incendiary munition attacks in Gaza.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour&#8217;s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Published in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-challenge-of-somatic-variants\\">The challenge of somatic variants</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by &#8216;somatic&#8217; variants acquired after birth rather than inherited &#8216;germline&#8217; variants from parents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Somatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Identifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-deepsomatic-works\\">How DeepSomatic works</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren&#8217;t inherited. These variations reveal what&#8217;s fuelling the tumour&#8217;s growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual&#8217;s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic can also work in &#8216;tumour-only&#8217; mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-training-a-more-precise-ai-cancer-research-tool\\">Training a more precise AI cancer research tool</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Training an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors. The data shows how even the same cancer type can have vastly different mutational signatures, information that can help predict patient response to specific treatments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic models performed better than other established methods across all three major sequencing platforms. The tool excelled at identifying complex mutations called insertions and deletions, or &#8216;Indels&#8217;. For these variants, DeepSomatic achieved a 90% F1-score on Illumina sequencing data, compared to 80% for the next-best method. The improvement was more dramatic on Pacific Biosciences data, where DeepSomatic scored over 80% while the next-best tool scored less than 50%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI performed well when analysing challenging samples.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour\u2019s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.\\nPublished in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.\\nThe challenge of somatic variants\\nCancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by \u2018somatic\u2019 variants acquired after birth rather than inherited \u2018germline\u2019 variants from parents.\\nSomatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.\\nIdentifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.\\nHow DeepSomatic works\\nIn clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren\u2019t inherited. These variations reveal what\u2019s fuelling the tumour\u2019s growth.\\nThe model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual\u2019s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.\\nDeepSomatic can also work in \u2018tumour-only\u2019 mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.\\nTraining a more precise AI cancer research tool\\nTraining an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.\\nThese samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors. The data shows how even the same cancer type can have vastly different mutational signatures, information that can help predict patient response to specific treatments.\\nDeepSomatic models performed better than other established methods across all three major sequencing platforms. The tool excelled at identifying complex mutations called insertions and deletions, or \u2018Indels\u2019. For these variants, DeepSomatic achieved a 90% F1-score on Illumina sequencing data, compared to 80% for the next-best method. The improvement was more dramatic on Pacific Biosciences data, where DeepSomatic scored over 80% while the next-best tool scored less than 50%.\\nThe AI performed well when analysing challenging samples. Testing included a breast cancer sample preserved with formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE), a common method that can introduce DNA damage and complicate analysis. It was also tested on data from whole exome sequencing (WES), a more affordable method that sequences only the 1% of the genome coding for proteins. In both scenarios, DeepSomatic outperformed other tools, suggesting its utility for analysing lower-quality or historical samples.\\nAn AI tool for all cancers\\nThe AI tool has shown it can apply its learning to new cancer types it wasn\u2019t trained on. When used to analyse a glioblastoma sample, an aggressive brain cancer, it successfully pinpointed the few variants known to drive the disease. In a partnership with Children\u2019s Mercy in Kansas City, it analysed eight samples of paediatric leukaemia and found the previously known variants while identifying 10 new ones, despite working with tumour-only samples.\\nGoogle hopes research labs and clinicians will adopt this tool to better understand individual tumours.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-echoes-of-the-dot-com-era\\">Echoes of the dot-com era</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Despite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Speaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-role-of-governments-and-global-policy\\">The role of governments and global policy</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Public policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As <em><a href=\\"https://hbr.org/2025/10/is-ai-a-boom-or-a-bubble\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Harvard Business Review</a></em> pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>China has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-market-warnings-over-a-possible-ai-bubble\\">Market warnings over a possible AI bubble</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-building-long-term-ai-infrastructure-amid-bubble-fears\\">Building long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn\u2019t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what\u2019s coming.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Miceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,\u201d he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-different-shades-of-caution\\">Different shades of caution</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across the industry, opinions vary on whether AI\u2019s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to <em><em><a href=\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/opinions-split-over-ai-bubble-after-billions-invested-2025-10-16/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Reuters</a></em></em>, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore\u2019s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding \u201chuge multiples\u201d despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones \u2014 though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.\\nEchoes of the dot-com era\\nDespite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.\\nSpeaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.\\nDawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.\\nThe role of governments and global policy\\nPublic policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As Harvard Business Review pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.\\nChina has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.\\nMeanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.\\nFor businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.\\nMarket warnings over a possible AI bubble\\nThe Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.\\nThis concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.\\nBuilding long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears\\nWhen asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.\\nRather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn\u2019t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what\u2019s coming.\\nMiceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,\u201d he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.\\nDifferent shades of caution\\nAcross the industry, opinions vary on whether AI\u2019s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.\\nAccording to Reuters, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore\u2019s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding \u201chuge multiples\u201d despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.\\nJeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones \u2014 though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.\\nAt Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable. He said the long-term case for AI investment is strong, but the ultimate winners are still uncertain given how quickly technology changes and how easily companies can switch providers.\\nMeanwhile, ABB CEO Morten Wierod told Reuters that while he doesn\u2019t see an AI bubble, supply chain and construction limits could slow the rollout of new data centres. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas added that even if there\u2019s a downturn, it\u2019s unlikely to cause a systemic financial crisis since AI investments aren\u2019t debt-driven.\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman also acknowledged market overexcitement, predicting that some investors will lose large sums while others will profit heavily \u2014 an outcome that mirrors past technology bubbles.\\nDespite growing talk of an AI bubble, many investors remain committed to the sector. UBS equity strategists said that about 90% of investors who think the market is overheated are still holding AI-related assets, suggesting most believe the industry has not yet peaked.\\nA cycle, not a collapse\\nWhile concerns about an AI bubble are valid, most experts agree that the technology\u2019s long-term impact is undeniable.

Autoregressive systems continue dominating commercial deployments due to proven performance in natural language understanding and generation\u2014the core requirements for customer-facing applications.\\nOpen-source strategy as market positioning\\nBy making the trillion-parameter AI model publicly available alongside the dInfer framework, Ant Group is pursuing a collaborative development model that contrasts with the closed approaches of some competitors.\xa0\\nThis strategy potentially accelerates innovation while positioning Ant\u2019s technologies as foundational infrastructure for the broader AI community.\\nThe company is simultaneously developing AWorld, a framework intended to support continual learning in autonomous AI agents\u2014systems designed to complete tasks independently on behalf of users.\\nWhether these combined efforts can establish Ant Group as a significant force in global AI development depends partly on real-world validation of the performance claims and partly on adoption rates among developers seeking alternatives to established platforms.\xa0\\nThe trillion-parameter AI model\u2019s open-source nature may facilitate this validation process while building a community of users invested in the technology\u2019s success.\\nFor now, the releases demonstrate that major Chinese technology firms view the current AI landscape as fluid enough to accommodate new entrants willing to innovate across multiple dimensions simultaneously.\\nSee also: Ant Group uses domestic chips to train AI models and cut costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool.

Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax.

This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents.

It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt. It\u2019s about business survival. Organizations are facing a critical shortage of COBOL expertise right when they need it most.\\nThe traditional approach has been to hire expensive consultants, spend 5+ years on manual conversion, and end up with auto-generated code that\u2019s unmaintainable. I\u2019ve seen this play out at multiple organizations. The consultants come in, run automated conversion tools, hand over thousands of lines of generated code, and leave. Then the internal team is stuck maintaining code they don\u2019t understand in a language they\u2019re still learning.\\nThe AI-powered approach changes this. You use AI to understand business logic, generate human-readable modern code, and maintain control of your intellectual property. Your team stays involved throughout the process. They learn the business logic as they go. The code that comes out the other end is something your developers can actually work with.\\nJulia explained the shift:\\nWhat a lot of customers do not want to actually give all their intellectual property like a hundred percent to a partner anymore, right? They want to keep it in check.\\nStart here: your path to becoming the modernization hero\\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with COBOL, ancient Java, or any legacy system, here\u2019s how you can start today:\\nStart small\\nIdentify one problematic legacy system (start with fewer than 5,000 lines)\\nUse GitHub Copilot to analyze a single file\\nDocument what you discover in markdown\\nShare findings with your team\\nBuild your AI toolkit\\nExperiment with the Azure Samples framework\\nLearn prompt engineering for code analysis (try: \u201cAnalyze this COBOL program and explain its business purpose in simple terms\u201d)\\nPractice iterative modernization techniques\\nThink beyond code\\nConsider nonfunctional requirements for cloud-native design\\nPlan for distributed systems architecture\\nRemember: most COBOL programs are doing simple CRUD operations. They don\u2019t need the complexity of a mainframe. They need the simplicity of modern architecture.\\nHere\u2019s a challenge: Find a legacy system in your organization. Six-month-old code counts as legacy in our industry. Try using GitHub Copilot to:\\nGenerate business logic documentation\\nIdentify potential modernization opportunities\\nCreate a migration plan with human validation checkpoints\\nShare your results on LinkedIn and tag me. I\u2019d love to see what you discover.\\nThe best time to start is now\\nThe most powerful insight from my conversation with Julia is this: AI doesn\u2019t replace developer expertise. It amplifies it.\\nCOBOL experts bring irreplaceable domain knowledge. Modern developers bring fresh perspectives on architecture and best practices. AI brings pattern recognition and translation capabilities at scale.\\nWhen these three forces work together, legacy modernization transforms from an impossible challenge into an achievable project.\\nThe best time to modernize legacy code was 10 years ago. The second-best time is now.\\nSpecial thanks to Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who shared her insights and experiences that made this blog post possible.\\nReady to dive deeper? Check out the full blog post about this project at aka.ms/cobol-blog and connect with Julia on LinkedIn for the latest updates.\\nThe age of legacy code doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier anymore. With the right AI tools and framework, even 65-year-old COBOL can become approachable, maintainable, and modern.\\nWhat legacy system will you modernize next?

We further introduce the Honeypot Utility Score (HUS), measuring both the attractiveness and feasibility of bait responses, and use a Defense Efficacy Rate (DER) for balancing safety and usability. Initial experiment on MHJ Datasets with recent attack method across GPT-4o show that our system significantly disrupts jailbreak success while preserving benign user experience."},{"creator":"hhutw","title":"Entire Linux Network stack diagram (2024)","link":"https://zenodo.org/records/14179366","pubDate":"Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:33:11 +0000","dc:creator":"hhutw","comments":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995","description":"\\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\\"https://zenodo.org/records/14179366\\">https://zenodo.org/records/14179366</a></p>\\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995\\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995</a></p>\\n<p>Points: 198</p>\\n<p># Comments: 17</p>\\n","content":"\\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\\"https://zenodo.org/records/14179366\\">https://zenodo.org/records/14179366</a></p>\\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995\\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995</a></p>\\n<p>Points: 198</p>\\n<p># Comments: 17</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"Article URL: https://zenodo.org/records/14179366\\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995\\nPoints: 198\\n# Comments: 17","guid":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995","isoDate":"2025-10-20T03:33:11.000Z","feedKey":"hacker-news","feedTitle":"Hacker News","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Entire Linux Network stack diagram (2024)","publishedDate":"2025-10-20T03:33:11.000Z","author":"hhutw","summary":"Article URL: https://zenodo.org/records/14179366\\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995\\nPoints: 198\\n# Comments: 17"},{"creator":"Associated Press","title":"China Accuses US of Cyberattack on National Time Center","link":"https://www.securityweek.com/china-accuses-us-of-cyberattack-on-national-time-center/","pubDate":"Mon, 20 Oct 2025 00:58:39 +0000","dc:creator":"Associated Press","description":"<p>The Ministry of State Security alleged that the NSA exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://www.securityweek.com/china-accuses-us-of-cyberattack-on-national-time-center/\\">China Accuses US of Cyberattack on National Time Center</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://www.securityweek.com\\">SecurityWeek</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>The Ministry of State Security alleged that the NSA exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://www.securityweek.com/china-accuses-us-of-cyberattack-on-national-time-center/\\">China Accuses US of Cyberattack on National Time Center</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://www.securityweek.com\\">SecurityWeek</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"The Ministry of State Security alleged that the NSA exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information.\\nThe post China Accuses US of Cyberattack on National Time Center appeared first on SecurityWeek.","guid":"https://www.securityweek.com/?p=44030","categories":["Cyberwarfare","China","cyberattack","Featured","NSA"],"isoDate":"2025-10-20T00:58:39.000Z","feedKey":"security-week","feedTitle":"Security Week","category":"news","cleanTitle":"China Accuses US of Cyberattack on National Time Center","publishedDate":"2025-10-20T00:58:39.000Z","author":"Associated Press","summary":"The Ministry of State Security alleged that the NSA exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information.\\nThe post China Accuses US of Cyberattack on National Time Center appeared first on SecurityWeek."},{"creator":"Lawrence Abrams","title":"TikTok videos continue to push infostealers in ClickFix attacks","link":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tiktok-videos-continue-to-push-infostealers-in-clickfix-attacks/","pubDate":"Sun, 19 Oct 2025 14:28:25 -0400","dc:creator":"Lawrence Abrams","description":"Cybercriminals are using TikTok videos disguised as free activation guides for popular software like Windows, Spotify, and Netflix to spread information-stealing malware.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour&#8217;s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Published in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-challenge-of-somatic-variants\\">The challenge of somatic variants</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by &#8216;somatic&#8217; variants acquired after birth rather than inherited &#8216;germline&#8217; variants from parents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Somatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Identifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-deepsomatic-works\\">How DeepSomatic works</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren&#8217;t inherited. These variations reveal what&#8217;s fuelling the tumour&#8217;s growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual&#8217;s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic can also work in &#8216;tumour-only&#8217; mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-training-a-more-precise-ai-cancer-research-tool\\">Training a more precise AI cancer research tool</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Training an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors. The data shows how even the same cancer type can have vastly different mutational signatures, information that can help predict patient response to specific treatments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeepSomatic models performed better than other established methods across all three major sequencing platforms. The tool excelled at identifying complex mutations called insertions and deletions, or &#8216;Indels&#8217;. For these variants, DeepSomatic achieved a 90% F1-score on Illumina sequencing data, compared to 80% for the next-best method. The improvement was more dramatic on Pacific Biosciences data, where DeepSomatic scored over 80% while the next-best tool scored less than 50%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI performed well when analysing challenging samples. Testing included a breast cancer sample preserved with formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE), a common method that can introduce DNA damage and complicate analysis. It was also tested on data from whole exome sequencing (WES), a more affordable method that sequences only the 1% of the genome coding for proteins. In both scenarios, DeepSomatic outperformed other tools, suggesting its utility for analysing lower-quality or historical samples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-an-ai-tool-for-all-cancers\\">An AI tool for all cancers</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI tool has shown it can apply its learning to new cancer types it wasn&#8217;t trained on. When used to analyse a glioblastoma sample, an aggressive brain cancer, it successfully pinpointed the few variants known to drive the disease.

Finding the specific genetic mutations driving a tumour\u2019s growth is essential for creating effective treatment plans. Doctors now regularly sequence tumour cell genomes from biopsies to inform treatments that can target how a particular cancer grows and spreads.\\nPublished in Nature Biotechnology, this work presents a tool that uses convolutional neural networks to identify genetic variants in tumour cells with greater accuracy than current methods. Google has made both DeepSomatic and the high-quality training dataset created for it openly available.\\nThe challenge of somatic variants\\nCancer genetics is complex. While genome sequencing finds genetic cancer variations, distinguishing real variants from sequencing errors is difficult and where an AI tool would provide welcome assistance. Most cancers are driven by \u2018somatic\u2019 variants acquired after birth rather than inherited \u2018germline\u2019 variants from parents.\\nSomatic mutations happen when environmental factors like UV light damage DNA, or when random errors occur during DNA replication. When these variants alter normal cell behaviour, they can cause uncontrolled replication, driving cancer development and progression.\\nIdentifying somatic variants is harder than finding inherited ones because they can exist at low frequencies within tumour cells, sometimes at rates lower than the sequencing error rate itself.\\nHow DeepSomatic works\\nIn clinical settings, scientists sequence both tumour cells from a biopsy and normal cells from the patient. DeepSomatic spots the differences, identifying variations in tumour cells that aren\u2019t inherited. These variations reveal what\u2019s fuelling the tumour\u2019s growth.\\nThe model converts raw genetic sequencing data from both tumour and normal samples into images representing various data points, including the sequencing data and its alignment along the chromosome. A convolutional neural network analyses these images to differentiate between the standard reference genome, the individual\u2019s normal inherited variants, and cancer-causing somatic variants while filtering out sequencing errors. The output is a list of cancer-related mutations.\\nDeepSomatic can also work in \u2018tumour-only\u2019 mode when normal cell samples are unavailable, which happens frequently with blood cancers like leukaemia. This makes the tool applicable across many research and clinical scenarios.\\nTraining a more precise AI cancer research tool\\nTraining an accurate AI model requires high-quality data. For its AI tool, Google and its partners at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the National Cancer Institute created a benchmark dataset called CASTLE. They sequenced tumour and normal cells from four breast cancer samples and two lung cancer samples.\\nThese samples were analysed using three leading sequencing platforms to create a single, accurate reference dataset by combining the outputs and removing platform-specific errors. The data shows how even the same cancer type can have vastly different mutational signatures, information that can help predict patient response to specific treatments.\\nDeepSomatic models performed better than other established methods across all three major sequencing platforms. The tool excelled at identifying complex mutations called insertions and deletions, or \u2018Indels\u2019. For these variants, DeepSomatic achieved a 90% F1-score on Illumina sequencing data, compared to 80% for the next-best method. The improvement was more dramatic on Pacific Biosciences data, where DeepSomatic scored over 80% while the next-best tool scored less than 50%.\\nThe AI performed well when analysing challenging samples. Testing included a breast cancer sample preserved with formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE), a common method that can introduce DNA damage and complicate analysis. It was also tested on data from whole exome sequencing (WES), a more affordable method that sequences only the 1% of the genome coding for proteins. In both scenarios, DeepSomatic outperformed other tools, suggesting its utility for analysing lower-quality or historical samples.\\nAn AI tool for all cancers\\nThe AI tool has shown it can apply its learning to new cancer types it wasn\u2019t trained on. When used to analyse a glioblastoma sample, an aggressive brain cancer, it successfully pinpointed the few variants known to drive the disease. In a partnership with Children\u2019s Mercy in Kansas City, it analysed eight samples of paediatric leukaemia and found the previously known variants while identifying 10 new ones, despite working with tumour-only samples.\\nGoogle hopes research labs and clinicians will adopt this tool to better understand individual tumours. By detecting known cancer variants, it could help guide choices for existing treatments. By identifying new ones, it could lead to new therapies. The goal is to advance precision medicine and deliver more effective treatments to patients.\\nSee also: MHRA fast-tracks next wave of AI tools for patient care\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-role-of-governments-and-global-policy\\">The role of governments and global policy</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Public policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As <em><a href=\\"https://hbr.org/2025/10/is-ai-a-boom-or-a-bubble\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Harvard Business Review</a></em> pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>China has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations.

A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.\\nEchoes of the dot-com era\\nDespite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.\\nSpeaking during Cisco\u2019s recent Virtual Media Roundtable \u2014 AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern \u2014 early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.\\nDawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.\\nThe role of governments and global policy\\nPublic policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds \u2014 and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As Harvard Business Review pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras \u2014 often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.\\nChina has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs \u2014 such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a \u20ac1 billion Apply AI fund \u2014 to boost adoption and competitiveness.\\nMeanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.\\nFor businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.\\nMarket warnings over a possible AI bubble\\nThe Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK\u2019s financial system \u201cmaterial.\u201d The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.\\nThis concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.\\nBuilding long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears\\nWhen asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.\\nRather than fearing overcapacity, he said what\u2019s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI.

After all, WordPress is often associated with open-source plugins, community themes, and a wide range of deployment practices\u2014some stronger than others. But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it\u2019s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer\u2014an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-dxp-vision-and-the-role-of-wordpress\\">DXP vision and the role of WordPress</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It\u2019s not a single product; it\u2019s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends\u2014websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-decouple\\">Why decouple?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\\">Core Web Vitals</a> scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don\u2019t degrade the visitor experience.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints\u2014instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication\\">authentication</a>. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-how-speed-helps-security\\">How speed helps security</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior\u2014maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed\u2014it&#8217;s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-wordpress-aligns-with-security-first\\">Why WordPress aligns with security-first</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community\u2019s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-architecture-that-reduces-risks\\">Architecture that reduces risks</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-headless-decoupled-architecture\\">Headless/decoupled architecture</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/firewall\\">Firewall</a> (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.<a></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-network-and-edge-security\\">Network and edge security</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot\\">bot</a> management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits\u2014ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further secure our infrastructure, we have robust <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/ddos\\">DDoS</a> mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.<a></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day\\">HTTPS</a> connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-service-isolation-and-least-privilege\\">Service isolation and least privilege</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role\u2014nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-hardening-at-the-application-layer\\">Hardening at the application layer</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-secure-configuration\\">Secure configuration</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies\\">cookies</a> and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To further reduce the platform\u2019s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality\u2014often abused for brute-force attacks\u2014and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits\\">exploit</a> to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-auth-and-session-security\\">Auth and session security</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it\u2019s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Access within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/cookie-hijacking\\">session hijacking</a> or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-data-handling\\">Data handling</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/sql-injection\\">SQL injection</a>, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of <a href=\\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii\\">personally identifiable information (PII)</a>, classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data\u2014supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-plugin-and-supply-chain-governance\\">Plugin and supply chain governance</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-controlled-ecosystem\\">Controlled ecosystem</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of \u201cmust-use\u201d (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform\u2019s foundational layers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-dependency-management\\">Dependency management</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases.

Further, these platforms may present hurdles in regions with strict data residency or compliance requirements, making them less suitable for regulated industries or global enterprises with nuanced jurisdictional needs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Systems like Drupal or fully-custom CMS architectures can undoubtably satisfy enterprise requirements for scale, extensibility, and security. However, in our evaluation, team expertise, the maturity and momentum of the adjacent tooling ecosystem, and a clear view of total cost of ownership all ultimately favored the adoption of WordPress.

With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP\u2014combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.</p>\\n","content:encodedSnippet":"It might surprise some that a security company would choose WordPress as the backbone of its digital content operations. After all, WordPress is often associated with open-source plugins, community themes, and a wide range of deployment practices\u2014some stronger than others. But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it\u2019s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer\u2014an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.\\nThe reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.\\nDXP vision and the role of WordPress\\nWhen we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It\u2019s not a single product; it\u2019s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.\\nIn that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends\u2014websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.\\nWhy decouple?\\nBy delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in Core Web Vitals scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don\u2019t degrade the visitor experience.\\nSecurity isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints\u2014instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and authentication. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.\\nThis architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.\\nHow speed helps security\\nRapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior\u2014maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.\\nShortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed\u2014it\u2019s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.\\nWhy WordPress aligns with security-first\\nOpen-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community\u2019s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.\\nThe core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.\\nFinally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.\\nArchitecture that reduces risks\\nHeadless/decoupled architecture\\nOur public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.\\nTo further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.\\nNetwork and edge security\\nOur Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced bot management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits\u2014ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.\\nTo further secure our infrastructure, we have robust DDoS mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.\\nWe enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure HTTPS connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.\\nService isolation and least privilege\\nOur security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role\u2014nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.\\nHardening at the application layer\\nSecure configuration\\nIn our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication cookies and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.\\nTo further reduce the platform\u2019s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality\u2014often abused for brute-force attacks\u2014and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may exploit to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.\\nAuth and session security\\nWe integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it\u2019s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.\\nAccess within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for session hijacking or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.\\nData handling\\nSecurity is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against SQL injection, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.\\nData privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of personally identifiable information (PII), classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data\u2014supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.\\nPlugin and supply chain governance\\nControlled ecosystem\\nOur approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of \u201cmust-use\u201d (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform\u2019s foundational layers.\\nBefore any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.\\nDependency management\\nWe take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.\\nOur CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.\\nVulnerability intelligence and patching\\nWe actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity\u2014ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.\\nIn the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we\u2019re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.\\nInfrastructure security operations\\nSecrets and data\\nWe enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.\\nAll data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers.

This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.\\nBackups and disaster recovery\\nOur disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, or ransomware attacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly. Explicit Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are defined, routinely tested, and adjusted as needed to meet the demands of our operations and regulatory obligations.\\nData recovery playbooks are meticulously maintained and encompass every critical aspect of our environment, from core content and media to infrastructure-as-code templates that can quickly and predictably rebuild our systems. These playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for recovering data and restoring services, whether in response to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a targeted attack. By rigorously documenting and testing these processes, we ensure a high degree of resilience and confidence in our ability to restore normal operations with minimal disruption, safeguarding both our assets and the experience of our users.\\nObservability and response\\nWe maintain a comprehensive observability stack with centralized, structured logging that aggregates data from all key layers\u2014Nginx, PHP-FPM, WordPress, and supporting services. This logging is enriched with real-time metrics and distributed traces, giving us end-to-end visibility into application performance and user activity across our digital experience platform (DXP). All logs are funneled into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which acts as the nerve center for detecting and investigating potential threats.

All form inputs are validated on the server, ensuring robust protection even if client-side checks are bypassed or disabled. This disciplined approach to input handling and abuse prevention ensures our forms remain a secure channel for legitimate user engagement while blocking malicious actors and automated attacks.\\nReliable and secure performance\\nCaching strategy\\nOur performance strategy centers on comprehensive caching and efficient data handling to deliver a fast, reliable experience for both users and administrators. Edge and page-level caching shield our origin servers by intercepting and serving frequent requests directly at the edge, dramatically reducing the number of dynamic requests that reach the core infrastructure. Object caching solutions like Redis, coupled with thoughtfully optimized queries, keep the admin interface responsive and ensure APIs remain quick even under load. We routinely profile database queries and set strict performance budgets for the slowest paths, preventing regressions that could degrade performance or escalate into broader availability issues. This layered approach ensures our platform stays speedy, stable, and scalable as demands grow.\\nBuild pipeline\\nEvery code change in our workflow is subjected to automated testing, with comprehensive suites that verify functionality, performance, and security. Security gates are tightly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that no changes are merged if any issues or vulnerabilities are detected. Our deployment processes are fully automated and repeatable, significantly reducing the potential for human error and guaranteeing that releases are consistent, predictable, and recoverable.\\nBy managing our infrastructure as code, we further ensure that all environments\u2014from development to production\u2014are consistent, auditable, and easily reproducible. This approach not only accelerates the provisioning of resources and the rollout of updates, but also strengthens compliance and traceability, providing a solid foundation for scalability, reliability, and continuous improvement.\\nUX and SEO\\nWe finely tune our security headers and Content Security Policies (CSPs) to deliver robust protection without disrupting the user experience, ensuring that all site functionality remains seamless and accessible. Our commitment to performance extends to advanced image optimization, responsive asset delivery, and strict adherence to accessibility standards, enabling our content to load quickly and be usable by everyone. By consistently delivering fast, accessible pages, we not only enhance user engagement but also enable rapid, safe deployment cycles\u2014minimizing potential attack windows through swift rollouts and efficient rollbacks, and maintaining both security and usability at the core of our platform.\\nAlternatives considered\\nProprietary Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) present a compelling all-in-one suite of features that can streamline operations for many organizations. However, their advantages often come with trade-offs: these platforms tend to be resource intensive, both in terms of infrastructure and licensing fees, and may lack the granular transparency required for deep security audits or targeted customizations. The inherent complexity and tightly-coupled nature of these solutions can slow the pace of change\u2014making it challenging to adapt or patch emergent threats rapidly, which is itself a significant security and business risk in dynamic environments.\\nHeadless-only SaaS CMSes, on the other hand, are designed for flexibility and API excellence, offering developers modern tooling and a frictionless integration experience. Despite these strengths, organizations may encounter challenges such as vendor lock-in, which can limit strategic choices and agility over time. Control over patching and updates is usually in the hands of the SaaS provider, potentially creating gaps between issue discovery and remediation. Further, these platforms may present hurdles in regions with strict data residency or compliance requirements, making them less suitable for regulated industries or global enterprises with nuanced jurisdictional needs.\\nSystems like Drupal or fully-custom CMS architectures can undoubtably satisfy enterprise requirements for scale, extensibility, and security. However, in our evaluation, team expertise, the maturity and momentum of the adjacent tooling ecosystem, and a clear view of total cost of ownership all ultimately favored the adoption of WordPress. WordPress\u2019s balance of flexibility, a wealth of existing integrations, well-understood operational paradigms, and strong community support enables us to deliver on our goals efficiently while ensuring we maintain the adaptability, security, and cost-effectiveness our organization requires.\\nWordPress provides the best mix of transparency, control, ecosystem breadth, and speed\u2014when paired with our security architecture and operating model.\\nLessons learned and best practices\\nStart headless and isolate the admin plane from day one.\\nEnforce SSO and MFA, least privilege roles, and formal change approval.\\nTreat plugins as third-party code: audit, monitor, and patch under SLAs.\\nInvest in observability and rehearse incident response regularly.\\nKeep WordPress core close to vanilla; extend through vetted plugins and mu-plugins, not core forks.\\nSecurity is not a property of a tool; it\u2019s the outcome of architecture, governance, and culture. With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP\u2014combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.","description":" It might surprise some that a security company would choose WordPress as the backbone of its digital content operations.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually <em>help</em> you code, not just autocomplete it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there&rsquo;s no shortage of new tools. And that&rsquo;s great. Developers need options.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers</strong>, according to <a href=\\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey\\">a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey</a>. Devs&nbsp;have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn&rsquo;t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t always been the fastest (though <a href=\\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot\\">our Changelog may beg to differ</a>) or the loudest. But we&rsquo;ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don&rsquo;t want their production code balanced on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1232\\" height=\\"2146\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146\\" alt=\\"A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91570\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1232 1232w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=172 172w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=588 588w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=882 882w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?w=1176 1176w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-from-autocomplete-to-actual-collaboration\\">From autocomplete to actual collaboration &#128187;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If 2024 was about showing what&rsquo;s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it <em>practical</em>. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI&rsquo;s latest releases to Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This evolution didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just one part of how far Copilot&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<aside data-color-mode=\\"light\\" data-dark-theme=\\"dark\\" data-light-theme=\\"light_dimmed\\" class=\\"wp-block-group post-aside--large p-4 p-md-6 is-style-light-dimmed has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained is-style-light-dimmed--1\\" style=\\"border-top-width:4px\\">\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading h5-mktg gh-aside-title is-typography-preset-h5\\" id=\\"h-built-into-the-platform-you-use-every-day\\" style=\\"margin-top:0\\">Built into the platform you use every day</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That&rsquo;s because agents don&rsquo;t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on <em>real</em> repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.</p>\\n</aside>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"from-idea-to-merge-in-record-time-%e2%9a%a1\\">From idea to merge in record time &#9889;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools.

It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually help you code, not just autocomplete it.\\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there\u2019s no shortage of new tools. And that\u2019s great. Developers need options.\\nBut with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers, according to a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey. Devs\xa0have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn\u2019t stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\\nWe haven\u2019t always been the fastest (though our Changelog may beg to differ) or the loudest. But we\u2019ve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don\u2019t want their production code balanced on it.\xa0\\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom autocomplete to actual collaboration \ud83d\udcbb\\nIf 2024 was about showing what\u2019s possible with AI, 2025 is about making it practical. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,\xa0 we\u2019ve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI\u2019s latest releases to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash.\xa0\\nThis evolution didn\u2019t happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn\u2019t, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\xa0\\nAnd that\u2019s just one part of how far Copilot\u2019s come. It\u2019s all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\xa0\\nBuilt into the platform you use every day\\nEvery AI vendor is racing to bolt their agentic tools into GitHub. That\u2019s because agents don\u2019t ship code in a vacuum. They plan tasks, open branches, run tests, and submit pull requests. And all of that already happens on GitHub where developers are collaborating on over 518 million projects.\\nSince Copilot lives inside the GitHub stack and has native support for GitHub MCP server, its agentic capabilities act on real repository context. It respects branch protections, works within your review cycles, and integrates directly with your CI/CD and security checks.\\nFrom idea to merge in record time \u26a1\\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\\nAgent mode: Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations\u2014all without leaving your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding agent: Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext-edit suggestions: Copilot predicts the next change you\u2019ll make and offers it inline. One Tab and you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow-latency completions: Most Copilot responses now render in under 400 ms (fast enough that you stop noticing them).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopilot CLI: The same brains, now in your terminal. Setup, debug, and script without switching windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMulti-model routing: Different jobs call for different brains. Copilot gives you access to multiple LLMs from leading frontier AI firms.\xa0\\nThe result: fewer interruptions, faster loops, and a workflow that finally keeps pace with how you think.\\nAI that scales with your workflow \ud83d\udcd0\\nCopilot doesn\u2019t live in a new environment you need to learn. It\u2019s part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\xa0\\nJetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity: Same Copilot, wherever you build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom instructions: Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGitHub MCP Server: Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkspace prompt files: Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20M+ developers strong: Every Copilot update compounds through the world\u2019s largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\\nCopilot isn\u2019t a separate tool you \u201cadd\u201d to GitHub. It\u2019s part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\\nSmarter, cleaner, and safer code \ud83d\udd0d\\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know). We\u2019ve spent a lot of cycles quietly leveling up Copilot\u2019s overall code quality and security guardrails where they matter most to you.\xa0\\nCopilot Autofix: Detects and patches vulnerabilities automatically (it was used to fix over a million vulnerabilities this year alone).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCode review: Summarizes diffs, flags logic bugs, and suggests fixes right inside your pull requests with a tool that powers millions of code reviews a month on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImproved model reasoning: Generates more readable, test-passing code with fewer lint errors and less regressions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL integration: Integrations with GitHub Advanced Security, Dependabot, and GitHub Actions keeps your supply chain solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilt-in privacy: Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant-level control mean your work stays off the grid.\xa0\\nOur research shows new code written with Copilot tends to have higher readability, better reliability, and improved maintainability scores.\xa0\\nHere\u2019s the good news: Copilot\u2019s backed by the same security stack that protects the world\u2019s largest open source ecosystem and more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal talk: Copilot vs. the rest \ud83d\udc40\\nLet\u2019s be honest: there are some great tools out there that make agentic coding workflows feel intuitive and bring real polish to multi-file editing.\xa0\\nCopilot lives in GitHub.

We&rsquo;re talking about <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#\\">COBOL</a>, a programming language that&rsquo;s been around for 65 years. That&rsquo;s older than the internet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here&rsquo;s the thing&mdash;COBOL isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. In fact, it&rsquo;s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem? <strong>Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns.</strong> The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-meet-the-developer-who-s-modernizing-cobol-without-learning-cobol\\">Meet the developer who&rsquo;s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I recently spoke with <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-kordick/\\">Julia Kordick</a>, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who&rsquo;s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What&rsquo;s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Julia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn&rsquo;t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions.

Here&rsquo;s what that looks like:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Translation:</strong> If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Structural analysis: </strong>COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you&rsquo;ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they&rsquo;re predictable. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>COBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>ENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>DATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>PROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ask GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\\"wp-block-code language-plaintext\\"><code>\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don&rsquo;t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL&rsquo;s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Documentation as source of truth:</strong> Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: &ldquo;Everything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>&#128161;Pro tip:</strong> COBOL&rsquo;s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like <code>ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE</code> are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"step-3-automation-aids-scaling-the-process\\">Step 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Julia&rsquo;s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what this orchestration looks like in practice:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Call chain mapping:</strong> Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Test-driven modernization:</strong> Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Dependency optimization:</strong> Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you&rsquo;re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Think of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-table\\"><table class=\\"has-fixed-layout\\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>&#128161;Pro tip:</strong> Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes.

We\u2019re talking about COBOL, a programming language that\u2019s been around for 65 years. That\u2019s older than the internet.\\nNow, your first instinct might be to laugh or maybe cry a little. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014COBOL isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, it\u2019s powering some of the largest and most critical systems on the planet right now.\\nThe problem? Finding developers who understand COBOL is like finding unicorns. The original developers are retiring, and yet 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still running our banks, insurance companies, and government systems.\\nBut here\u2019s the plot twist: we now have the opportunity to support the unicorns. We have GitHub Copilot and autonomous AI agents.\\nMeet the developer who\u2019s modernizing COBOL (without learning COBOL)\\nI recently spoke with Julia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt, who\u2019s modernizing COBOL systems using AI. What\u2019s remarkable? She never learned COBOL.\\nJulia brought her AI expertise and worked directly with the people who had decades of domain knowledge. That partnership is the key insight here. She didn\u2019t need to become a COBOL expert. Instead, she focused on what she does best: designing intelligent solutions. The COBOL experts provided the legacy system knowledge.\\nWhen this whole idea of Gen AI appeared, we were thinking about how we can actually use AI to solve this problem that has not been really solved yet.\\nJulia Kordick, Microsoft Global Black Belt\\nThe three-step framework for AI-powered legacy modernization\\nJulia and her team at Microsoft have cracked the code (pun intended) with a systematic approach that works for any legacy modernization project, not just COBOL. Here\u2019s their GitHub Copilot powered, battle-tested framework.\\nStep 1: Code preparation (reverse engineering)\\nThe biggest problem with legacy systems? Organizations have no idea what their code actually does anymore. They use it, they depend on it, but understanding it? That\u2019s another story.\\nThis is where GitHub Copilot becomes your archaeological tool. Instead of hiring consultants to spend months analyzing code, you can use AI to:\\nExtract business logic from legacy files.\\nDocument everything in markdown for human review.\\nAutomatically identify call chains and dependencies.\\nClean up irrelevant comments and historical logs.\\nAdd additional information as comments where needed.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Always have human experts review AI-generated analysis. AI is incredible at pattern recognition, but domain knowledge still matters for business context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\u2019s what GitHub Copilot generates for you:\xa0\\n# Business Logic Analysis Generated by GitHub Copilot\\n## File Inventory\\n- listings.cobol: List management functionality (~100 lines)\\n- mainframe-example.cobol: Full mainframe program (~10K lines, high complexity)\\n\\n## Business Purpose\\nCustomer account validation with balance checking\\n- Validates account numbers against master file\\n- Performs balance calculations with overdraft protection\\n- Generates transaction logs for audit compliance\\n\\n## Dependencies Discovered\\n- DB2 database connections via SQLCA\\n- External validation service calls\\n- Legacy print queue system\\nStep 2: Enrichment (making code AI-digestible)\\nYou usually need to add context to help AI understand your code better. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\\nTranslation: If your code has Danish, German, or other non-English comments, translate them. Models work better with English context.\\nStructural analysis: COBOL has deterministic patterns. Even if you\u2019ve never written COBOL, you can leverage these patterns because they\u2019re predictable. Here\u2019s how:\\nCOBOL programs always follow the same four-division structure:\\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION (metadata about the program)\\nENVIRONMENT DIVISION (file and system configurations)\\nDATA DIVISION (variable declarations and data structures)\\nPROCEDURE DIVISION (the actual business logic)\\nAsk GitHub Copilot to map these divisions for you. Use prompts like:\\n\\"Identify all the divisions in this COBOL file and summarize what each one does\\"\\n\\n\\"List all data structures defined in the DATA DIVISION and their purpose\\"\\n\\n\\"Extract the main business logic flow from the PROCEDURE DIVISION\\"\\nThe AI can parse these structured sections and explain them in plain English. You don\u2019t need to understand COBOL syntax. You just need to know that COBOL\u2019s rigid structure makes it easier for AI to analyze than more flexible languages.\\nDocumentation as source of truth: Save everything AI generates as markdown files that become the primary reference. Julia explained it this way: \u201cEverything that you let Copilot generate as a preparation, write it down as a markdown file so that it can actually reference these markdown files as source of truth.\u201d\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: COBOL\u2019s verbosity is actually an advantage here. Statements like ADD TOTAL-SALES TO ANNUAL-REVENUE are almost self-documenting. Ask Copilot to extract these business rules into natural language descriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Automation Aids (Scaling the Process)\\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed and enriched individual files, you need to understand how they all fit together. This is where you move from using Copilot interactively to building automated workflows with AI agents.\\nJulia\u2019s team built a framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel, which orchestrates multiple specialized agents. Each agent has a specific job, and they work together to handle the complexity that would overwhelm a single AI call.\\nHere\u2019s what this orchestration looks like in practice:\\nCall chain mapping: Generate Mermaid diagrams showing how files interact. One agent reads your COBOL files, another traces the CALL statements between programs, and a third generates a visual diagram. You end up with a map of your entire system without manually tracing dependencies.\\nTest-driven modernization: Extract business logic (agent 1), generate test cases that validate that logic (agent 2), then generate modern code that passes those tests (agent 3). The tests become your safety net during migration.\\nDependency optimization: Identify utility classes and libraries that you can replace with modern equivalents. An agent analyzes what third-party COBOL libraries you\u2019re using, checks if modern alternatives exist, and flags opportunities to simplify your migration.\\nThink of it like this: Copilot in your IDE is a conversation. This framework is a production line. Each agent does one thing well, and the orchestration layer manages the workflow between them.\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1Pro tip: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex dependencies before making any changes. It helps you catch edge cases early. You can generate these diagrams by asking Copilot to trace all CALL statements in your codebase and output them in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid chart example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality check: It\u2019s not a silver bullet\\nJulia\u2019s brutally honest about limitations:\\nEveryone who\u2019s currently promising you, \u2018hey, I can solve all your mainframe problems with just one click\u2019 is lying to you.\\nThe reality is:\\nHumans must stay in the loop for validation.\\nEach COBOL codebase is unique and complex.\\nWe\u2019re early in the agentic AI journey.\\nFull automation is probably at least five years away.\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make massive progress today.\\nSee it in action: the Azure samples framework\\nJulia and her team have open-sourced their entire framework. It\u2019s built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic orchestration and includes:\\nMultiple specialized agents: DependencyMapperAgent, COBOLAnalyzerAgent, JavaConverterAgent\\nCost tracking: See exactly how much each AI operation costs (usually $2-5 per 1000 lines analyzed)\\nHuman validation points: Built-in checkpoints for expert review\\ndoctor.sh: A configuration and testing script that gets you started quickly\\nTry running the COBOL modernization framework:\\nFork the repository: aka.ms/cobol\\nSet up your environment: Configure Azure OpenAI endpoint (or use local models for sensitive data)\\nRun the doctor script: ./doctor.sh doctor validates your setup and dependencies\\nStart modernization: ./doctor.sh run begins the automated process\\n# Quick setup for the impatient developer\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\ncd Legacy-Modernization-Agents\\n\\n./doctor.sh setup\\n\\n./doctor.sh run\\nThe business case that changes everything\\nThis isn\u2019t just about technical debt.

Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqright\\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\\"more-72321\\"></span></p>\\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">leaked in 2016</a>\xa0by <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_36755\\" style=\\"width: 743px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-36755\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"733\\" height=\\"417\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-36755\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016.

One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72354\\" style=\\"width: 716px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"size-full wp-image-72354\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"706\\" height=\\"190\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72354\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\\n\u201cIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,\u201d Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, \u201cCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.\u201d\\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016\xa0by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\\n\\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\\n\\nDobbins said Aisuru\u2019s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\\n\u201cThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.\u201d\\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle \u201c9gigsofram,\u201d which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik \u201c9gigsofram\u201d Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru\u2019s botmasters chose Buckingham\u2019s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\\n\u201cThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,\u201d Coelho said.\\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn\u2019t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,\u201d he said.\\nRAPID SPREAD\\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru\u2019s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\\n\u201cMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,\u201d XLab wrote on September 15. \u201cThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.\u201d\\n\\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\\n\\nAisuru\u2019s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice\xa0charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru\u2019s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government\u2019s takedown, Dobbins said.\\n\u201cFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that\u2019s great, but unfortunately the botnet\u2019s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.\u201d\\n\\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name \u201cEthan J. Foltz\u201d in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\\n\\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\\nXLab\u2019s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: \u201cSnow,\u201d who\u2019s responsible for botnet development; \u201cTom,\u201d tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and \u201cForky,\u201d responsible for botnet sales.\\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky\u2019s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\\n\\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP\u2019s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,\u201d Forky replied. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.\u201d","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/#comments","description":"The world\'s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving Discord user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker Red Hat.\\n\\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\\n\\nIn May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as ShinyHunters launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization\u2019s Salesforce portal.\\nThe first real details about the incident came in early June, when the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\xa0warned that ShinyHunters \u2014 tracked by Google as UNC6040 \u2014\xa0was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.\\nLast week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed \u201cScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters\u201d began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.\\n\u201cContact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,\u201d the website stated in a message to Salesforce. \u201cIf we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.\u201d\\nBelow that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).\\n\\nImage: Mandiant.\\n\\nOn October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).\\n\u201cAlot of folders have their client\u2019s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client\u2019s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,\u201d the hackers claimed.\\nTheir claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the Crimson Collective took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.\\nRed Hat disclosed on October 2 that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.\\n\u201cThe compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat\u2019s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,\u201d Red Hat wrote.\\nSeparately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord said an incident on September 20 at a \u201cthird-party customer service provider\u201d impacted a \u201climited number of users\u201d who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren\u2019t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole vast amounts of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.\\nIn a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.\\n\u201cSalesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,\u201d the message to customers read. \u201cOur focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\u201d\\nThe GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as UNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon\u2019s AWS.\\nGoogle catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in UNC6240 for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups \u2014 Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group\u2019s new clearnet blog \u2014 breachforums[.]hn \u2014 which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.\\nBut before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software. Oracle has since confirmed that a security flaw tracked as CVE-2025-61882 allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.\\nMandiant\u2019s Charles Carmakal shared on LinkedIn that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. Bleeping Computer writes that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.\\nOn Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled \u201cShiny hunters,\u201d contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.\\n\\nA screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.\\n\\nKrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.\\nThe link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal\u2019s analysis on this malware is here). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.\\nMandiant\u2019s Austin Larsen said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as ASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.\\n\\nA scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.\\n\\n\u201cDownloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,\u201d Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. \u201cCapabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.\u201d\\nMalware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.\\nWith so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from companies victimized by data theft.\\nU.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo \u2014 U.K. resident Thalha Jubair \u2014\xa0who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against Marks & Spencer and Harrods, the British food retailer Co-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions at MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.\\n\\nA Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Teenagers.\u201d\\n\\nIn August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida man Noah Michael Urban was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.\\nIn April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member was extradited from Spain to the U.S., where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft.

But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day.

Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS.

Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann.

The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023.

It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a 2012 mass murder described by the former US Attorney General as a \u201cheinous act of hatred and terror\u201d.\\nBellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from SoCal Research Club (SCRC) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or \u201cany sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre\u201d before he was contacted by journalists about it.\\nSmith said he was told by the event\u2019s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot \u201can active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the \u2018crowd\u2019 for the filming and that it would include women and children,\u201d Smith told Bellingcat, \u201cso of course I thought nothing of it.\u201d\xa0\\nUpon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was \u201cdisappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience\u201d.\\nThe international Active Club movement focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, who is currently on probation in the United States after having pleaded guilty in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.\\nSince 2023, Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual \u201cfight nights\u201d held in the US, where white nationalist groups that focus on training their members to fight against their purported enemies gather.\xa0\\n\u201cCollaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,\u201d Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.\xa0\\n\u201cExposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,\u201d Beirich added, \u201cespecially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.\u201d\\nSmith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.\\n\u201cI was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] \u2018thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,\u2019\u201d he told Bellingcat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\xa0\\nSoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s requests for comment.\\nIdentifying Details: An Orange Wall\\nOn Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.\xa0\\nThe photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has links to the Active Club movement, particularly in the United States. Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including assault and murder.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; the banner on the top left of the image is a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, an international neo-Nazi gang whose German branch was banned by authorities in that country in 2023.\\n\\nA photo posted by a SoCal Active Club on Sept. 2, 2025; Bellingcat has obscured the banners on the wall, including a Hammerskins banner and an Active Club banner.\\nA 12-second black-and-white teaser video released by the far-right propaganda outlet founded by Rundo\xa0gave a blurry idea of the shape of the building and the ceiling of the venue.\\n\\nTop left and bottom left: screenshots from a video posted by the hosts, showing the heavily-blurred background of the venue. Despite the blurring, the layout of the background matches that of the venue from the YouTube video and Peerspace photos from the venue (top right and bottom right). Bellingcat has obscured the individual in the front of the photos.\\nThese images provided crucial clues for Cope and researchers from SCRC, a Southern California-based research collective that monitors and shares information on hate and extremist groups, including Active Clubs. Based on local knowledge of the area and their familiarity with the activities of members of the Active Club chapter in Southern California, they began searching for San Diego County gyms and warehouses with boxing rings for rent. They found the venue the same day the teaser video was released, Cope said.\\nBellingcat was able to confirm that this was the location of the Active Club combat sports event, using videos and images from previous events held by the wrestling school\xa0(which we are choosing not to name as there is no evidence that they have any involvement in the event).\xa0\\nIn a video posted on the school\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025 \u2013 two weeks before the Active Club event \u2013 the same orange wall and black banners with orange trim that are only partially obscured at the Active Club event, are visible. Also visible in both the venue\u2019s YouTube video and the photos posted from the Active Club event is a wooden ceiling beam, with wires on the left-hand side.\\n\\nA screenshot of a video posted on the venue\u2019s YouTube channel on Aug. 17, 2025, from a professional wrestling event unrelated to the far-right combat sports event; the participants are wearing masks as part of a professional wrestling match. Bellingcat has cropped the screenshot to obscure the identities of spectators.\\n\\nA zoomed-in version of the above screenshot, showing the same wooden blocks and wires visible in photos posted by one of the Active Club hosts of the event.\\nAnother photo posted by the hosts further confirmed that the professional wrestling venue was the location of the Active Club combat sports event. In a photo taken of one of the neo-Nazi bands that performed at the event, brown beams and wires are visible on the ceiling; these same beams and wires, in the same positions, can be seen in photos posted by the venue on their Peerspace page advertising the venue for rent for events.\\n\\n(top) Image from photo posted by SoCal Active Club that shows distinctive ceiling features at the venue; (bottom left and right) Photos from the venue\u2019s Peerspace page which show the same ceiling features.

In their post after the event, the SoCal Active Club hosts thanked two US-based neo-Nazi bands for their musical performances after the fights, praising the bands for \u201creally topping the event off with incredible energy.\u201d\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBellingcat is not naming the bands to avoid amplification, who have been active for many years in US and international neo-Nazi music scenes.\\nBoth bands have had members associated with violence, including mass murder. A former member of one of the bands, Wade Michael Page, murdered seven people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 before taking his own life in what US authorities called a hate crime and a terrorist act. Page was also a member of the Hammerskins.\xa0\\nA current member of the other band that performed at the Active Club event pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempted involuntary manslaughter and served prison time for his crime. This band member punched a man outside a Michigan bar and ultimately caused the man\u2019s death from a severe brain injury.\\nAccording to the GPAHE\u2019s Beirich, the presence of these bands is \u201ca major cause for concern, albeit unsurprising considering the purpose of the Active Club movement is based on beliefs in an impending, and unavoidable, race war\u201d.\\n\u201cThe history of violence associated with Active Clubs is clear,\u201d Beirich added.\\nEvening Vigil Turned Into Alleged Assault\\nTwo weeks after the combat sports event on Sept. 13, members of one of the Active Clubs that organised it participated in an alleged assault in Huntington Beach, California.\xa0\\nMembers of Patriot Front, SoCal Active Club and other far-right and neo-Nazi groups took part in an evening vigil in Huntington Beach, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, in honour of assassinated right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\\nAccording to reporting from the event by The LA Ten Four, a newsletter covering issues surrounding first responders in the Los Angeles area, the man who was attacked was a vigilgoer who confronted the far-right group along with several others, calling them \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and following the group into a parking garage.\xa0\\n\\nVideo taken by LA Ten Four shows multiple men punching and kicking an individual.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/globalsumudflotilla/p/DOXEm8viAZO/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">official statement</a> said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/DGGN1956/posts/812698534423606?ref=embed_post\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">National Guard on Facebook</a> stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior <a href=\\"https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">published</a> a statement, saying the incident &#8220;that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZqrkLCnSl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">video</a> showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat.

No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXaR_MiOZ_/?igsh=YjdnaTEybGNocW94\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">recorded</a> from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast &#8211; the highest point on the vessel &#8211; before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"551\\" height=\\"987\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Gaza-flotilla-higher-colour-reduction-gif.gif\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49793\\"/></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Screencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat.

He can be seen <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXL9KhjJaK/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">in a video</a> from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXMeRaiq9t/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">said</a> in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Duarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXSL3jClWD/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">available</a> open sources documenting this strike.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"915\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49774\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets.jpg 1080w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-300x254.jpg 300w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Burned-Life-Jackets-768x651.jpg 768w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Burned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don&#8217;t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9St5_lZ9Ns\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">as visible in this video</a>), and the boat&#8217;s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it&#8217;s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8872431/mmsi:255915808/imo:0/vessel:FAMILY\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">MarineTraffic</a>, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Second Attack</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On September 9, the GSF <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">reported</a> a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZhFhnCCmx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">Members of the crew</a> stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat.

The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.\\nThe first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF\u2019s official statement said the Family Boat was \u201cstruck by a drone in Tunisian waters\u201d, causing a fire on \u201cthe main deck and below deck storage\u201d. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.\xa0\\nTunisian official sources first said there was \u201cno evidence of any hostile act or external targeting\u201d. A statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard on Facebook stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets \u201cas a result of a lighter or cigarette butt\u201d. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior published a statement, saying the incident \u201cthat took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack\u201d.\\nThe GSF reported that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a video showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.\\nThe First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal\\nFollowing the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one recorded from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat\u2019s mast \u2013 the highest point on the vessel \u2013 before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country\u2019s National Guard.\\nThe object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the flaming object falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites at a higher point than the highest point of the ship. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nEyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen in a video from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He said in a statement that he \u201csaw a drone clearly about 4m above\u201d his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.\xa0\\nDuarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat\u2019s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the available open sources documenting this strike.\xa0\\nHowever, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.\\n\\nBurned life jackets where the incendiary munition landed on the Family Boat.

Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: \u201cThe videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.\u201d He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object \u201ccould conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.\u201d\\nDr. Jenzen-Jones also said that \u201cthe sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.\u201d\\nPetro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, \u201cit looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail\u201d.\xa0\\nAudio from the video footage also reveals the presence of a sound in the background that appears to be consistent with that of a drone.\\nBellingcat asked Faine Greenwood, owner of Tarentum Consulting LLC and an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles, to review the video. After watching the footage, Faine stated that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to say conclusively that this is a drone, as we don\u2019t actually get a chance to see it. However, I do think that the nature of the recorded sound, the trajectory of the dropped explosive (as visible in this video), and the boat\u2019s known proximity to the shoreline/port do make me think that it\u2019s highly plausible that this was a drone attack of some kind, likely carried out with a multirotor-type platform and not with a fixed wing.\u201d\\nMarineTraffic, a global ship tracking database, shows that the Family Boat was moored within approximately 1.62 kilometres of land at the time of the incident.\\nThe Second Attack\\nOn September 9, the GSF reported a second attack, this time targeting the Alma. Members of the crew stated they saw a drone hovering over the ship, which then dropped the incendiary munition similar to the one that struck the Family Boat. The crew managed to put out the fire, and there were no injuries and only minor damage.\\n\\nScreencaptures from a video released by the Global Sumud Flotilla showing the incendiary object landing on the Alma. Frames are numbered in order of appearance. (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla)\\nThe GSF released a video showing the incendiary munition landing on the rear of the vessel, erupting into a fireball that oversaturates the camera, similar to the strike on the Family Boat. Once the camera is no longer oversaturated, a fire is visible burning on the deck before being extinguished by those on board.\\n\\ndocument.createElement(\'video\');\\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Synced-Drops.mp4\\nComparison of videos showing the incendiary munitions falling on the Family Boat (left) and Alma (right). (Credit: Instagram/Global Sumud Flotilla; Instagram/Tony La Piccirella)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incendiary munition that landed on the Alma appears to be the same type as the one visible in the first attack on the Family Boat. They both seem to follow the same trajectory, have a comparable flaring appearance as they fall, and both create fireballs on impact that oversaturate the cameras.\xa0\\nUnlike the attack on the Family Boat, munition remnants were recovered and shared by GSF after the Alma incident.\xa0\\nMauricio Morales, a journalist travelling with the GSF, sent Al Jazeera a photo of the remnants recovered after the attack on the Alma. It appears to show a grenade attached to a webbing or bag.\\n\\nMunition remnants recovered on the Alma, showing a grenade attached to burned remnants of a webbing or bag, with a visible clasp.

Jenzen-Jones, from Armament Research Services, who said: \u201cThey appear to show what would ordinarily be a hand-thrown munition amongst the remains of a melted synthetic bag or pouch. This may be an incendiary grenade, or possibly a smoke grenade used to ignite an incendiary composition held in the bag. The safety pin and safety lever of the grenade appear to be absent, consistent with it being armed and capable of functioning.\u201d\\nThermite grenades and smoke grenades are of similar construction, with the same general external appearance. While the above reference image of a US AN-M14 thermite grenade is painted red, the colours vary between manufacturers of thermite grenades.\\n\\nLeft and Right: Grenade recovered aboard Alma. Centre: Israeli smoke grenade. The grenade fuze seen is consistent with the construction of Israeli grenade fuzes, but these features are not exclusive, according to experts. The grenade found at Alma appears to have a similar green paint. The peripheral protection for the split pin is circled in white. The external clip for the safety pin is circled in red.

These features are common, but not exclusive, to some models of Israeli hand grenades. Better images will likely reveal important diagnostic details, potentially even remnants of markings on the body of the munition.\u201d\\n\\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur, posted an additional photo of the grenade and attached webbing. (Credit: X/Francesca Albanese)\\nWhile the exact type of grenade \u2013 thermite or smoke \u2013 cannot be determined from the available imagery, the characteristics of the falling incendiary munitions seen striking the Family Boat and Alma clearly indicate the use of an incendiary composition.\\nIncendiary grenades are typically filled with thermite or a similar incendiary composition. According to a recent report from Forbes, thermite is not nearly as effective as explosive munitions against armoured targets or personnel. While it is very effective against flammable targets.\\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c https://t.co/JyW72b2J2Z #RussianUkrainianWar pic.twitter.com/1cBzpB2J8f\\n\u2014 Necro Mancer (@666_mancer) March 5, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous visual references for incendiary munitions.
