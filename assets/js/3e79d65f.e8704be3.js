Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> &#8212; the biggest attack that <strong>Google</strong> had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p>\\n<p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote <strong>Roland Dobbins</strong>, principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>, in a recent <a href=\\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p>\\n<p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;<strong>residential proxy</strong>&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-31323\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"631\\" height=\\"264\\" /></p>\\n<p>From a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>\\n<p>And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH</h2>\\n<p><strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> is co-founder of <a href=\\"https://spur.us\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:</p>\\n<p>AUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097<br />\\nRAYOBYTE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 43,894<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa043,008<br />\\nWEBSHARE_PROXY\xa0 \xa039,800<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 32,723<br />\\nPROXYCHEAP_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,368<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,202<br />\\nMYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY\xa0 25,287<br />\\nHYPE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 18,185<br />\\nMASSIVE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 17,152</p>\\n<p>Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;</p>\\n<p>LUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421<br />\\nNETNUT_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 10,982,458<br />\\nABCPROXY_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 9,294,419<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa06,754,790<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa03,209,313<br />\\nEARNFM_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,659,913<br />\\nNODEMAVEN_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,627,851<br />\\nINFATICA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,335,194<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,032,027<br />\\nYILU_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 1,549,155<span id=\\"more-72424\\"></span></p>\\n<p>Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bright Data</strong> was formerly known as <strong>Luminati Networks</strong>, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said <strong>Rony Shalit</strong>, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and <a href=\\"https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a robust opt-in only residential peers</a>, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>HK NETWORK</h2>\\n<p>Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.</p>\\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\\"https://synthient.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Synthient</a>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own <strong>software development kit</strong> or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is <em>forced to install</em> some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p>\\n<p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.</p>\\n<p>Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy service is <strong>IPidea</strong>, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include <strong>ABCProxy </strong>(#3), <strong>Roxlabs</strong>, <strong>LunaProxy</strong>, <strong>PIA S5 Proxy</strong>, <strong>PyProxy</strong>, <strong>922Proxy</strong>, <strong>360Proxy</strong>, <strong>IP2World</strong>, and <strong>Cherry Proxy.\xa0</strong>Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said they also track <strong>Yilu Proxy\xa0</strong>(#10) as IPidea.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &#8220;<strong>HK Network</strong>.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The way it works is there&#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'&#8221; Brundage explained. &#8220;But they&#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72441\\" style=\\"width: 760px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72441\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"517\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png 1126w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-768x529.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-782x539.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-100x70.png 100w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\" /></a><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies.

In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-deep-dive-into-the-residential-proxy-service-911/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China</a>. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/911-proxy-service-implodes-after-disclosing-breach/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the company&#8217;s servers were massively hacked</a>.</p>\\n<p>That 2022 story named <strong>Yunhe Wang</strong> from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">arrested Mr Wang</a>, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72454\\" style=\\"width: 759px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72454\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\" wp-image-72454\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"494\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png 1182w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy-768x507.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy-782x516.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72454\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">The website for 922Proxy.</p></div>\\n<h2>DATA SCRAPING FOR AI</h2>\\n<p>In recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimate benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p>\\n<p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqleft\\">&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said.</span> &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p>\\n<p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">report</a> earlier this year from <strong>LibreNews</strong> found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">pay-per-crawl</a>&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, but it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p>\\n<p>On October 22, the social media and news network <strong>Reddit</strong> <a href=\\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Denas Grybauskas</strong>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p>\\n<p>In July 2025, Google filed <a href=\\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME</h2>\\n<p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name <strong>fuckbriankrebs[.]com</strong>. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; and was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>\\n<p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72457\\" style=\\"width: 745px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72457 \\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"735\\" height=\\"707\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.\\n\\nFirst identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru\u2019s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.\\nIn June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second \u2014 the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru\u2019s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second \u2014 well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.\\nThese digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.\\n\u201cMultiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. \u201cOutbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.\u201d\\nThe incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru\u2019s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world\u2019s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.\\nExperts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else\u2019s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.\\n\\nFrom a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.\\nAnd as we\u2019ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.\\n\u2018INSANE\u2019 GROWTH\\nRiley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months \u2014 with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.\\n\u201cI just checked, and in the last 90 days we\u2019ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cThat is insane. That is so high of a number, it\u2019s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.\u201d\\nTo put Kilmer\u2019s comments in perspective, here was Spur\u2019s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:\\nAUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097\\nToday, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;\\nLUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421\\n\\nReached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur\u2019s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\\nBright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur\u2019s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur\u2019s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.\\n\u201cWe did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data\u2019s in some way,\u201d said Rony Shalit, Bright Data\u2019s chief compliance and ethics officer. \u201cIn many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.\u201d\\n\u201cOur network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,\u201d Shalit continued. \u201cEvery DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.\u201d\\nHK NETWORK\\nEven Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.\\nBenjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it\u2019s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What\u2019s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.\\nBrundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user\u2019s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.\\n\u201cProxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.\u201d\\nMany SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.\\nDepending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time \u2014 all maintained through other means, Brundage said.\\n\u201cOften, you\u2019ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.\u201d\\nSome proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider\u2019s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he\u2019d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.\\nBrundage says that by almost any measurement, the world\u2019s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur\u2019s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.\xa0Spur\u2019s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy\xa0(#10) as IPidea.\\nBrundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as \u201cHK Network.\u201d\\n\u201cThe way it works is there\u2019s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, \u2018Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we\u2019ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'\u201d Brundage explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.\u201d\\n\\nA graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.\\n\\nThose apps include a range of low-cost and \u201cfree\u201d virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user\u2019s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.\\n\u201cThey have all this bandwidth to offload,\u201d Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. \u201cAnd they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.\u201d\\nOne of IPidea\u2019s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy\u2019s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company\u2019s servers were massively hacked.\\nThat 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.\\n\\nThe website for 922Proxy.\\n\\nDATA SCRAPING FOR AI\\nIn recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimate benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That\u2019s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to block, because there\u2019s a risk of blocking real people,\u201d Spur\u2019s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.\\nKilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.\\n\u201cWeb crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cEverybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.\u201d\\nKilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.\\n\u201cWhere the cost of data is out of reach \u2014 there is some exclusivity or reason they can\u2019t access the data \u2014 they\u2019ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,\u201d Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.\\nAggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.\\nCloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company\u2019s \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d feature is currently in a private beta, but it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.\\nOn October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.\\n\u201cRecognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThey do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.\u201d\\nDenas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.\\n\u201cReddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,\u201d Grybauskas said in a written statement. \u201cOxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.\u201d\\nAs big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.\\nIn July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet\u2019s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet \u201ccompromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android\u2019s open-source software, which lacks Google\u2019s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.\u201d\\nA FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME\\nBrundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate \u201cscrew you\u201d to this site\u2019s author: One of the botnet\u2019s alleged partners goes by the handle \u201cForky,\u201d and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nBrundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru\u2019s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a \u201ckill switch\u201d capable of disrupting the botnet\u2019s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.\\n\\nA tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain.

Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d for the security intelligence company Seralys.\\nCaturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.\\nBut even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said.

To execute these flaws, an attacker would social engineer a target into previewing an email with a malicious Microsoft Office document.\\nSpeaking of Office, Microsoft quietly announced this week that Microsoft Word will now automatically save documents to OneDrive, Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform.

With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-bellingcat-donate-block\\"><div><div class=\\"wp-block-image alignleft\\">\\n<figure class=\\"is-resized\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/05/question-mark.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"27\\" height=\\"27\\"/></div></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Support Bellingcat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\\">\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-button\\"><a class=\\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\\" href=\\"https://bellingcat.com/donate?utm_campaign=article_cta\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Donate</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Denis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">poisoned</a> by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"600\\" height=\\"978\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49959\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg 600w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi-184x300.jpg 184w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Vladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by <em>Monika Pakhomi (left) </em>on Nov. 8, 2019.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann. Top left: The Overlander Airport, where he allegedly met an aircraft on Dec 27, 2024. Bottom left: cocaine seized by the AFP. Right: Herrmann after he was detained. Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

A source told the newspaper that Clark replaced the engine at least once in Brazil, indicating he was continuously flying it long-haul, and may have fitted a third engine due to the number of flying hours he was accumulating.\xa0\\nClark\u2019s plane crashed about an 11-hour flight from the Amazon basin, a region that has become a major trafficking route for cocaine bound for Europe, the drug\u2019s fastest-expanding market.\xa0\\n\\nThe wreckage of Clark\u2019s plane, which crashed earlier this month in Coruripe on the southern coast of the Brazilian state of Alagoas.

Teams are shipping code faster than ever, but such a rapid pace can introduce security vulnerabilities if not managed correctly. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is an important practice for finding security flaws in running applications. However, manual DAST scans can be slow and cumbersome, creating bottlenecks that undermine the very agility they are meant to support.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Automating DAST is the solution. By integrating security testing directly into the development pipeline, engineering and DevOps teams can identify and fix vulnerabilities early without sacrificing speed. This guide provides a roadmap for automating DAST, from understanding its benefits to implementing it effectively in your CI/CD workflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-problem-with-manual-dast\\">The problem with manual DAST</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditionally, DAST scans were performed late in the development cycle, often by a separate security team. This approach is no longer sustainable for fast-growing tech companies. Manual DAST introduces several significant challenges:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Slow feedback loops:</strong> When scans are run manually, developers may not receive feedback on vulnerabilities for days or even weeks. By then, the code has moved on, making fixes more complex and costly to implement. The<a href=\\"https://owasp.org/www-community/Automated_Scanning\\"> OWASP Foundation</a> highlights how delays in vulnerability discovery can slow remediation and increase risk.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Scalability issues:</strong> As an organisation grows and the number of applications and services multiplies, manually managing DAST scans becomes nearly impossible. It doesn&#8217;t scale with the pace of cloud-native development. According to a<a href=\\"https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/FactSheets/ICSFACTSHEET-12-011-01.pdf\\"> US Department of Homeland Security report</a>, manual processes can&#8217;t effectively support increasing application complexity and interconnectivity.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Inconsistent coverage:</strong> Manual processes are prone to human error. Scans might be forgotten, configured incorrectly, or not run against all relevant environments, leading to gaps in security coverage.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Developer disruption:</strong> Tossing a long list of vulnerabilities over the wall to developers disrupts their workflow. It forces them to switch context from current tasks to fix problems in older code, killing productivity.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These issues create friction between development and security teams, positioning security as a roadblock rather than a shared responsibility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-why-automate-dast-the-core-benefits\\">Why automate DAST? The core benefits</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Automating DAST transforms it from a late-stage gatekeeper into an integrated part of the development lifecycle. The benefits are immediate and impactful.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Efficiency and speed</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By integrating DAST scans into the CI/CD pipeline, tests run automatically with every code commit or deployment. This provides developers with instant feedback on the security implications of their changes. It eliminates manual hand-offs and waiting times, allowing teams to maintain their development velocity. Vulnerabilities are caught and fixed when they are cheapest and easiest to address \u2013 right after they are introduced.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Improved security and coverage</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Automation ensures that security testing is consistent and comprehensive. You can configure automated scans to run against development, staging, and production environments, guaranteeing continuous coverage in your entire application landscape. The systematic approach reduces the risk of human error and ensures that no application is left untested. The right<a href=\\"https://www.aikido.dev/blog/top-dynamic-application-security-testing-dast-tools\\"> DAST tools</a> can be configured once and then trusted to run consistently, improving your overall security posture.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Scalability for growing teams</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For companies scaling from 50 to 500 developers, manual security processes break down. Automation is essential for managing security in hundreds of applications and microservices. An automated DAST workflow scales effortlessly with your team and infrastructure. New projects automatically inherit the same security testing standards, ensuring governance and consistency without adding manual overhead.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Empowering developers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When DAST is automated in the pipeline, security becomes a natural part of the developer&#8217;s workflow. Results appear in the tools they already use, like GitHub or GitLab. The &#8220;Shift Left&#8221; approach empowers developers to own the security of their code. It fosters a culture of security as a shared responsibility, rather than the sole domain of a separate team.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-a-practical-guide-to-implementing-dast-automation\\">A practical guide to implementing DAST automation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Getting started with DAST automation doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. Here are practical steps to integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline. For a broad overview of leading practices and current tooling, the<a href=\\"https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Dynamic_Application_Security_Testing_(DAST)\\"> OWASP DAST overview</a> offers an excellent starting point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>1.

Teams are shipping code faster than ever, but such a rapid pace can introduce security vulnerabilities if not managed correctly. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is an important practice for finding security flaws in running applications. However, manual DAST scans can be slow and cumbersome, creating bottlenecks that undermine the very agility they are meant to support.\\nAutomating DAST is the solution. By integrating security testing directly into the development pipeline, engineering and DevOps teams can identify and fix vulnerabilities early without sacrificing speed. This guide provides a roadmap for automating DAST, from understanding its benefits to implementing it effectively in your CI/CD workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem with manual DAST\\nTraditionally, DAST scans were performed late in the development cycle, often by a separate security team. This approach is no longer sustainable for fast-growing tech companies. Manual DAST introduces several significant challenges:\\nSlow feedback loops: When scans are run manually, developers may not receive feedback on vulnerabilities for days or even weeks. By then, the code has moved on, making fixes more complex and costly to implement. The OWASP Foundation highlights how delays in vulnerability discovery can slow remediation and increase risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScalability issues: As an organisation grows and the number of applications and services multiplies, manually managing DAST scans becomes nearly impossible. It doesn\u2019t scale with the pace of cloud-native development. According to a US Department of Homeland Security report, manual processes can\u2019t effectively support increasing application complexity and interconnectivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInconsistent coverage: Manual processes are prone to human error. Scans might be forgotten, configured incorrectly, or not run against all relevant environments, leading to gaps in security coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeveloper disruption: Tossing a long list of vulnerabilities over the wall to developers disrupts their workflow. It forces them to switch context from current tasks to fix problems in older code, killing productivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese issues create friction between development and security teams, positioning security as a roadblock rather than a shared responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy automate DAST? The core benefits\\nAutomating DAST transforms it from a late-stage gatekeeper into an integrated part of the development lifecycle. The benefits are immediate and impactful.\\nEfficiency and speed\\nBy integrating DAST scans into the CI/CD pipeline, tests run automatically with every code commit or deployment. This provides developers with instant feedback on the security implications of their changes. It eliminates manual hand-offs and waiting times, allowing teams to maintain their development velocity. Vulnerabilities are caught and fixed when they are cheapest and easiest to address \u2013 right after they are introduced.\\nImproved security and coverage\\nAutomation ensures that security testing is consistent and comprehensive. You can configure automated scans to run against development, staging, and production environments, guaranteeing continuous coverage in your entire application landscape. The systematic approach reduces the risk of human error and ensures that no application is left untested. The right DAST tools can be configured once and then trusted to run consistently, improving your overall security posture.\\nScalability for growing teams\\nFor companies scaling from 50 to 500 developers, manual security processes break down. Automation is essential for managing security in hundreds of applications and microservices. An automated DAST workflow scales effortlessly with your team and infrastructure. New projects automatically inherit the same security testing standards, ensuring governance and consistency without adding manual overhead.\\nEmpowering developers\\nWhen DAST is automated in the pipeline, security becomes a natural part of the developer\u2019s workflow. Results appear in the tools they already use, like GitHub or GitLab. The \u201cShift Left\u201d approach empowers developers to own the security of their code. It fosters a culture of security as a shared responsibility, rather than the sole domain of a separate team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA practical guide to implementing DAST automation\\nGetting started with DAST automation doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Here are practical steps to integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline. For a broad overview of leading practices and current tooling, the OWASP DAST overview offers an excellent starting point.\\n1. Choose the right DAST tool\\nThe first step is selecting a DAST tool that fits your team\u2019s needs. Look for solutions that are built for automation.

Ensuring code quality, understanding AI\u2019s influence on your workflow, and maintaining control over how AI interacts with your codebase and organization are essential for your team\u2019s success, and we\u2019re tackling these challenges head-on.\\nWhen it comes to code quality, the core problem is that \u201cLGTM\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean \u201cthe code is healthy.\u201d A review can pass, but can still degrade the codebase and quickly become long-term technical debt. With GitHub Code Quality, in public preview today, you\u2019ve got org-wide visibility, governance, and reporting to systematically improve code maintainability, reliability, and test coverage across every repository. Enabling it extends Copilot\u2019s security checks to look at the maintainability and reliability impact of the code that\u2019s been changed.\\nAnd we\u2019ve added a code review step into the Copilot coding agent\u2019s workflow, too, so Copilot gets an initial first-line review and addresses problems (before you even see the code).\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an organization, you need to know how Copilot is being used. So today, we\u2019re announcing the public preview of the Copilot metrics dashboard, showing Copilot\u2019s impact and critical usage metrics across your entire organization.\\nFor enterprise administrators who are managing AI access, including AI agents and MCP, we\u2019re focused on providing consistent AI controls for teams with the control plane\u2014your agent governance layer. Set security policies, audit logging, and manage access all in one place. Enterprise admins can also control which agents are allowed, define access to models, and obtain metrics about the Copilot usage in your organization.\\nFor developers, by developers\xa0\\nWe built Agent HQ because we\u2019re developers, too. We know what it\u2019s like when it feels like your tools are fighting you instead of helping you. When \u201cAI-powered\u201d ends up meaning more context-switching, more babysitting, more subscriptions, and more time explaining what you need to get the value you were promised.\xa0\\nThat ends today.\\nAgent HQ isn\u2019t about the hype of AI. It\u2019s about the reality of shipping code.\xa0 It\u2019s about bringing order and governance to this new era without compromising choice. It\u2019s about giving you the power to build faster, with more confidence, and on your terms.\\nWelcome home.

Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub</strong>. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>AI is reshaping choices, not just code. </strong>In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that&rsquo;s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And one of the biggest things in 2025? <strong>Agents are here.</strong> Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we&rsquo;re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128161; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a visual learner, we have you covered.&#128071;</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\"><div class=\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\">\\n<iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" title=\\"Octoverse 2025: AI, India, and the new #1 programming language\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"281\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-u6dUg6IJk?feature=oembed\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\\">The state&#8239;of&#8239;GitHub in&#8239;2025: A year of record growth</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1152\\" height=\\"288\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288\\" alt=\\"Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91477\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1152 1152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1024 1024w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million.

Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub\u2014over 36 million in the past year. It\u2019s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.\xa0\\nThe release of GitHub Copilot Free in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged 43.2 million pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)\u2014including a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\xa0\\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s data highlights three key shifts:\xa0\\nGenerative\u202fAI is now standard in development. More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug \u201825 vs. Aug \u201824). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn\u2019t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is reshaping choices, not just code. In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that\u2019s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? Agents are here. Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we\u2019re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s jump in.\\n\ud83d\udca1 Oh, and if you\u2019re a visual learner, we have you covered.\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state\u202fof\u202fGitHub in\u202f2025: A year of record growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\\nSo, what does \u201cmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average\u201d actually mean?\xa0\\nDevelopers are converging on GitHub. More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\xa0\\nAI adoption starts immediately. We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use GitHub Copilot within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\xa0\\nThe talent boom is geographically diverse. Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\xa0\\nGitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of Copilot Free in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub\u2019s dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\\n\\n2025\u2011YTD lensContributionsShare of totalWhat it signals\\n\\nPrivate repositories4.97B\u2248\u202f81.5%Enterprise and team\u2011level collaboration is happening on GitHub.\xa0\\nPublic repositories1.12B\u2248\u202f18.5%The volume of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey numbers\\n180M+ developers are now on GitHub\\n630M total repositories with +121M new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\\n+58M private repositories (up \u202f33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\xa0\\nOpen source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub. 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\\nDeveloper productivity: shipping more, waiting less\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following the SPACE framework (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year\u2019s data.\\nDeveloper activity reached record levels in 2025\\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\\n\\nActivity2024 monthly average2025 monthly average\\n\\nIssues closed\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4M4.25M\\nPull requests merged\u202f35M43.2M\\nCode pushes65M82.19M\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the preview of Copilot coding agent in March and the introduction of Copilot code review in April. In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\xa0\\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\\nPull requests created: +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\\nIssues created: +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\\nComments on issues/PRs: essentially flat (+0.35%)\\nComments on commits: down -27% (sharp decline)\\nThese are observational signals rather than causal claims and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks and Dockerfiles highlight two stages of modern development\\nNotebooks are now a mature tool for experimentation, while Dockerfiles are considered the bridge to reproducibility and production. In 2025, 2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY) and 1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY). This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\\n\\nRepositories in\u202f2024Repositories in\u202f2025Delta\\n\\nJupyter Notebook present\u202f1.4M2.42M\xa0+75%\\nDockerfile present\u202f875k1.9M+120%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents enter the mainstream\\nAI code\u202freview helps developers. We conducted in-depth interviews with developers about their code review process and found that 72.6% of developers who use Copilot code review said it improved their effectiveness.\xa0\\nDevelopers are using AI and agentic tools to build and share their work faster. Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\xa0\\nWhat about vibe coding?\xa0\\nOne notable trend in 2025 was \u201cvibe coding.\u201d First coined by Andrej Karparthy, vibe coding emerged as shorthand for a developer workflow that starts with an idea and jumps straight to a runnable proof-of-concept (often in a single evening, powered by AI autocompletion and copy-pastable cloud tooling).\xa0\\nIt might sound playful, but its implications are serious: if AI-assisted tools continue to lower the barrier to entry, we could see programming literacy expand dramatically. We\u2019ll be watching this space for bigger signals in the months and years to come.\\nWhere the world codes\u202fin\u202f2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last five years have redrawn not just GitHub\u2019s developer map, but also the distribution of global activity, faster than any period on record.\\nA new global top\u202f10\\nIndia added more than 5.2 million developers in 2025, which accounts for a little over 14% of GitHub\u2019s total +36 million new developers in 2025. That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\\n* Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) computed from raw counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed?\\nSignificant growth came from India, Brazil, and Indonesia. These regions combine large, young developer populations with expanding internet access and booming startup ecosystems. Many are also seeing some of the fastest growth in AI-related projects, as local companies adopt new tools to compete globally.\\nOver the past five years (from 2020 to 2025), India, Brazil, and Indonesia have more than quadrupled the number of developers on the platform; Japan and Germany have more than tripled their developer numbers; and the USA, UK, and Canada have more than doubled the number of developers on the platform.\\nBrazil, in particular, is benefiting from activity investment in fintech and open banking.\\nIndonesia continues to grow with its rise as Southeast Asia\u2019s digital powerhouse (it accounts for nearly half the region\u2019s online economy!).\\nRegional growth snapshots\\n\\nRegionStand\u2011out markets2024\u202fto \u202f2025 net new devsWhat\u2019s fueling the boom\\n\\nAPACIndia, Japan, Indonesia,\xa0+13MGovernment skilling, AI\u2011assisted local\u2011language tooling.

(You can get more information about this in our methodology section.)\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe results of our analysis suggest India will continue to expand its lead, reaching 57.5 million developers by 2030, and accounting for more than one in three of all projected sign ups worldwide. The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\\nNotably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\\nKey takeaways\\nOne in every three new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn\u2019t in the global top 10 in 2020.\\nIndia alone added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth.\\nThe AI boom is global:\u202fThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\xa0\xa0\\nOpen source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source development reached record levels this year with 1.12 billion contributions across public repositories (+13% YoY). March 2025 marked the largest single month of new open source contributors in GitHub history: 255,000 first-timers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 395 million public repositories hosted 1.12 billion contributions and 518.7 million merged pull requests\u2014each a record.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s fastest\u2011growing projects by contributors\\nSix of the 10 fastest-growing repositories were AI infrastructure projects, underscoring demand for runtimes, orchestration, and efficiency tools.\\nStandards also saw big growth: Model Context Protocol (MCP) hit 37k stars in just eight months, though it\u2019s not on our lists below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top open source projects by contributors\\n2025\u2019s top projects split between AI infrastructure (vllm, ollama, huggingface/transformers) and enduring ecosystems (vscode, godot, home-assistant).\\nOn one side, projects like vllm, ollama, ragflow, llama.cpp, and huggingface/transformers dominate, confirming that contributors are investing in the foundation layers of AI\u2014model runtimes, inference engines, and orchestration frameworks.\\nOn the other side, mainstay ecosystems such as vscode, godot, expo, and home-assistant continue to attract steady contributor bases, showing that open source momentum extends well beyond AI.\\nThe takeaway?

AI infrastructure projects are prominent among top-growth repositories. When we zoom out to the top 20 projects (not all of these are captured in our above graphic), we see a few things at play:\xa0\\nReproducibility and dependency hygiene are hot. The rise of astral-sh/uv and NixOS/nixpkgs points to a hunger for deterministic builds, faster installs, and less \u201cworks on my machine.\u201d\\nPerformance-centric developer tools win attention. Ghostty, Tailwind CSS, and uv are all about speed, tight feedback loops, and minimal friction.\\nDevelopers are contributing to projects that emphasize privacy and control. Zen Browser and Clash-Verge reflect interest in privacy, content control, and routing around networks.\\nOpen source social media continues to grow. As one of the biggest social projects, Bluesky\u2019s momentum suggests developers are still investing in open protocols and portable identity.\\nAI, tinkering, and frontend projects attract first-time contributors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 20% of the most popular open source projects among first-time contributors in 2025 were AI-focused. But we\u2019re also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\xa0\\nMost of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure. Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\\nMajor platforms bring visibility. microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\\nfirstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\\nSmart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers. Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d\\nFrontend and dev tool projects also light up. shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\\nAI\u2011native vs. evergreen ecosystems\\nAI podium. Six of the overall top 10 projects by total contributors are AI\u2011centric (vllm, huggingface/transformers, modelcontextprotocol/servers, llama.cpp, etc.). They averaged +150\u202f% contributor growth YoY\u2014triple the OSS median.\\nEvergreen pull. Internet of things (home\u2011assistant), game development (godotengine/godot), and the Python language itself (cpython) still add thousands of contributors per quarter.\\nThe global landscape in open source activity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia now has the largest public and open source contributor base in the world. This reflects both the country\u2019s booming developer population and its increasing role in OSS adoption.\\nThe U.S. continues to lead in contributions. Despite having fewer contributors, U.S.-based developers contributed more to public and open source projects on GitHub. This suggests higher per-developer activity.\\nBrazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier. Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\\nCommunity health: Governance isn\u2019t keeping pace with developer activity\\n\u200b\u200bGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\xa0\\nREADME reach: ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\xa0\\nContributor guides: At 5.5%, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\\nCodes of Conduct: 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They\u2019re foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration. This guide to getting your repository collaboration-ready shares what documentation is most important for fostering a sense of shared ownership.\\nKey takeaways for 2025\\n395M public and open source repositories (+19% YoY)\\n1.12B public and open source contributions (+13% YoY)\\n518.7M pull requests merged (+29% YoY)\\n60% of top 10 open source projects by contributors are AI\u2011focused\\nOnly 1\u202fin\u202f50 repositories ships with a Code of Conduct\\nSecurity: from \u201cshift left\u201d to secure\u202fby\u202fdefault\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\xa0\\nAutomation is driving this acceleration. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving common OWASP Top 10 issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\xa0\\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories (+172% YoY). Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub\u2019s engineers published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow, which offers some valuable lessons).\xa0\\nAutomation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\\nDevelopers are automating more build, test, and security activity. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That\u2019s up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year\u2019s report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\\nAutomation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy. Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\\nMonthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. Only ~1\u202fin\u202f3 fixes ships within the same month it\u2019s proposed.\\nSecurity alerts follow the same pattern: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\\nFaster fix times\\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\xa0\xa0\\nConfiguring and codifying security\\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in dependabot.yml more than doubled this year (846k, +137% YoY), marking a shift from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cpatch me automatically, within guardrails.\u201d\\n\\nSignal2024 (cumulative)2025\u202f (cumulative)YoY\\n\\nRepositories with dependabot.yml356k846k+137%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken Access Control overcame Injection to become the top CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories. New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\\nThis points to a broader issue: authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs. Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same category became the fastest-growing target for Copilot Autofix. By mid-2025, developers were accepting AI-generated fixes for Broken Access Control in 6,000+ repositories per month. Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\\nOpenSSF Scorecard status: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the OpenSSF Scorecard via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\xa0\\nThe top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\\nMethodology note\\nUnless otherwise specified, year-over-year growth rates throughout this section reflect August 2025 vs. August 2024, a same-month year-over-year comparison used to control for seasonality in monthly contributor counts.\\nTypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\\nPython remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (\u2248403k repositories; +17.8% YoY inside AI-tagged projects).\\nJavaScript is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn\u2019t just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed in 2025\\n\\nRank 2025LanguageYoY contributor gainYoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)Big takeaway\\n\\n1TypeScript~1,054,01566.63%TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development.\\n2Python~850,57948.78%Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python\u2019s usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work.\xa0\\n3JavaScript~427,14824.79%Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript.\\n4Java~174,70520.73%Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth.\\n5C#~136,735\xa022.22%Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython still trails the combined JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, a continuation of last year\u2019s trend that highlights just how large the typed and untyped JavaScript community remains.\xa0\\nBut starting in 2025, Python\u2019s growth curve began to track almost identically in parallel with JavaScript and TypeScript, suggesting that AI adoption is influencing language choice across these ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat else we\u2019re seeing\\nPython dominates AI projects. It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\\nTyped > loosely typed. TypeScript\u2019s growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as \u201cJavaScript\u201d activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\\nEnterprise stacks endure. Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\\nLegacy experiments emerge. COBOL appeared in our dataset with nearly 3,000 active developers\u2014likely driven by organizations and hobbyists creating AI-assisted tutorial repositories aimed at modernizing legacy codebases.\\nThe fastest-growing languages by percentage growth\\nThe following languages may not have the biggest developer communities behind them, but each has at least 1,000 monthly contributors and they\u2019re posting the fastest year-over-year growth rates on GitHub.\xa0\\n\\nLanguageCurrent developer countYoY %Why it\u2019s hot\\n\\nLuau>3,600>194%Luau is Roblox\u2019s scripting language and a gradually typed language, reflecting a broader industry trend toward typed flexibility.\xa0\\nTypst>3,600>108%As a modern LaTeX alternative, Typst aims to make academic and technical publishing faster, less cryptic, and more collaborative.\\nAstro>45,600>78%Astro\u2019s \u201cislands architecture\u201d and focus on shipping zero-JavaScript by default resonate with developers building fast, content-heavy sites (we added Astro to Linguist in 2021, which is our source for languages).\\nBlade>91,100>67%As Laravel\u2019s templating engine, Blade rides on Laravel\u2019s continued dominance in PHP web development.\\nTypeScript>2,600,000>67%Offering type safety for the JavaScript world, TypeScript\u2019s combination of JavaScript ubiquity and type safety is compelling for both greenfield and legacy projects (plus, its types work well with AI coding tools).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore stacks for new projects built in the last 12 months\\nNearly 80% of new repositories used just six languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and C#. These core languages anchor most modern development.\\n\\nLanguageTotal repositories (Sep 2024-Aug 2025)\xa0Growth (Jan-Aug 2025 vs. Jan-Aug 2024)\xa0What this growth tells us\\n\\nPython9,261,58753.41%AI\u2019s default glue with growth driven by ML, agents, notebooks, and orchestration.\\nJavaScript9,345,04614.57%Still ubiquitous for scripts and web apps, though growth is slower as TypeScript gains share.\\nTypeScript5,394,25678.10%Typed standard for modern web dev. Ideal for safe API/SDK integration, especially with AI.\\nJava3,520,2159.35%Reliable enterprise and backend workhorse. Gradual AI integration without language churn.\\nC++1,701,55211.82%Performance-critical workloads used in game engines, inference, and embedded systems supporting AI.\\nC#1,478,46310.61%Steady enterprise and game dev usage, with AI capabilities folded into established ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional insights:\xa0\\nExperimentation is becoming more common. Though not a language, Jupyter Notebooks grew 24.5% YoY, with exploratory LLM experiments and data analysis now generating new standalone repos rather than remaining siloed in monorepos.\\nPerformance and systems languages are rising with AI (but not evenly). C grew ~20.9% YoY and C++ grew ~11.8% YoY, reflecting demand for faster runtimes, inference engines, and hardware-optimized loops.\\n.NET stays strong. C# grew ~10.6% YoY, consistent with enterprise and game/tooling ecosystems. This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\\nThe languages powering AI development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython and Jupyter Notebook continue to anchor new AI projects, but the story this year is Python\u2019s growth. Python now powers nearly half of all new AI repositories (582,196; +50.7% YoY), underscoring its role as the backbone of applied AI work, from training and inference to orchestration and deployment. Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for experimentation (402,643; +17.8% YoY), but the shift toward Python codebases signals more projects moving out of prototypes and into production stacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end and app-layer languages grew sharply from smaller bases\u2014TypeScript +77.9% (85,746) and JavaScript +24.8% (88,023)\u2014mirroring the rise of demos, dashboards, and lightweight apps built around model endpoints. Shell scripts (+324%) emerged as the fastest riser, reflecting how teams codify eval harnesses, data prep, and deployment pipelines. And C++ crossed 7,800 repos (+11%), a steady reminder of its role in performance-critical inference engines, runtimes, and hardware-close systems.\\nWhy TypeScript won in 2025\\nBy the numbers. TypeScript finished #1 on GitHub in August 2025 with 2,636,006 monthly contributors (+1.05M YoY; +66.6%) and led new repositories.\xa0\\nTyped contracts scale AI-assisted teams. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch LLM errors before production.\\nFrameworks ship with TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate a TypeScript codebase by default (npm create, pnpm dlx, or bunx create).\xa0\\nTyped systems help identify LLM-generated compile errors earlier in the pipeline. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures.\xa0\\nLow barrier to entry. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and IDE autoconfig hide boilerplate, so junior devs can spin up typed stacks quickly.\\nGenerative\u202fAI and agentic workflows become ordinary engineering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year we saw AI move from experiment to mainstream. In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\xa0\\nAI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million, nearly doubling in less than two years.\\nRoughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week, showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly contributors to generative-AI projects climbed sharply across our measurement year. From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan\u2013Aug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan\u2013Aug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\\nKey takeaways:\xa0\\nGenerative AI is becoming infrastructure. More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August \u201825 vs. August \u201824), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\xa0\\nGrowth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping. Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\xa0\\nAI in open source. Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using GitHub Copilot.\\nEarly evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot. Python-based code accelerated mid-2025 while Notebook growth flattened\u2014signaling packaging into production. (By year\u2019s end, Notebooks rebounded, keeping pace with Python.)\\nStrong signals of mainstream appeal\xa0\\n\\nData pointWhy it matters\\n\\n178% YoY increase in projects that import an LLM SDK1.13M+ public repositories now import an LLM SDK; 693k+ were created in the last 12 months alone.Growth rates indicate a shift from early experimentation to sustained building.\\nContributors up >3X since 2023Monthly distinct contributors to AI repos rose from 68k (Jan 2024) to ~200k (Aug 2025). August 2025 is up 111% YoY vs. August 2024.AI work is no longer the domain of specialists.\\nMonthly contributions near 6MMonthly commits/contributions to AI projects reached ~6.0M (Aug 2025) hitting a peak of 6.28M (Jun 2025). August 2025 is up 188% YoY vs. August 2024.More code, more often, offering evidence of production-grade adoption and active iteration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScale replaces hype\\n1.13M+ public repositories now depend on generative-AI SDKs (up 178% YoY). More than 693k+ were created in the last 12 months, sharply outpacing 2024\u2019s total (~400,000). The compounding curve that began in early 2023 shows no sign of tapering; every week, on average, we are still seeing new all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho\u2019s shipping the code?\\nThe U.S. remains the largest source of contributions (~12.8M, 31.8%). India ranks second (~5M, 12.5%) and leads by distinct repositories (405k vs. 342k).\\nA second tier (Germany, Japan, U.K., Korea, Canada, Brazil, Spain, France) contributes another ~40%, globalizing the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgentic tools are now being adopted in day-to-day workflows\\nThis year, GitHub Copilot coding agent went from demo to GA and we\u2019re starting to see its impact.\\nA first glimpse of coding agent shows 1+ million pull requests that were created between May 2025 and September 2025.\\nWhere it\u2019s showing up:\\nA repository-level comparison of public repositories with \u22651 coding agent-authored pull request vs. a random sample without Copilot coding agent shows strong selection effects: coding agent activity is skewed toward repositories with more stars, larger size, and greater age. In other words, teams aren\u2019t only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they\u2019re trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\xa0\\nWe invite the community to run within-repository experiments (A/B or stepped-wedge) and matched analyses conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We\u2019ll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\xa0\\nAI is driving notable breakouts in open source\\nGenerative AI projects continue to be among GitHub\u2019s most popular. Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\xa0\\n\\nRepository (age \u22643 yrs unless noted)AI connection\\n\\nvllm-project/vllmOpen source vision-language model + training/inference stack\\nggml-org/llama.cppLocal Llama inference on CPU/GPU\\ninfiniflow/ragflowEnd-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template\\ncline/cline\u201cLLM-native\u201d command-line shell that reasons over local context\\nhuggingface/transformers (6.6 yrs)Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat this tells us\\nSoftware infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity. Brand-new generative AI repositories (\u2264 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\\nStandards are emerging in real time. The rapid rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\\nAI is reshaping classic tooling. Projects like ollama and ragflow show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\\nAI is helping developers fix code, too\\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\\nBroken access control surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in 6,000+ repositories per month by mid-2025.\\nSecurity logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\\nAutofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues\u2014not just exotic vulnerabilities\u2014bringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\\nHere\u2019s how to stay ahead\\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI\u2014systems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis\u2014is emerging.\\nExpect AI libraries to become \u201cplumbing.\u201d If your stack can\u2019t load a model or pipe context into one, you\u2019ll feel legacy-bound quickly.\xa0\\nGo beyond notebooks. Package your experiments early to share them with others.\\nWatch the toolchain, not just the models. The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today\u2019s fast-rising repositories.\\nBuild for interoperability. Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\\nTake this with you\\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn\u2019t replace developers\u2014it would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\\nThe past year marked historic milestones:\xa0\\nIndia overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub. It\u2019s also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\\nTypeScript became the most used language for the first time, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\\nOpen source remains the foundation. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\\nThe story of 2025 isn\u2019t AI versus developers. It\u2019s about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\\nGlossary\\n2025: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\xa0\\nYear-over-year language comparisons: Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\\nContributions: Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\xa0\\nContributors: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\xa0\\nDeveloper: Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries\u2014from software development to data analysis and design.\\nTotal repositories: The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\\nProgramming language usage: Unless otherwise noted, \u201cmost used\u201d languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for \u201cTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.\u201d\\nAI-related repository: Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d \u201cLLM\u201d) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\\nAgentic workflows: Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\\nCopilot coding agent: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment\u2014subject to developer review and approval.\\nCopilot code review: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\\nGitHub Actions minutes: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\\nCodeQL: GitHub\u2019s semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\\nMona rank: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final \u201cMona Rank\u201d based on the summed rank.\\nLLM SDK: A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\xa0\\nMethodology\\nScope & coverage\\nOctoverse year: Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025.\\nUnless noted, metrics reflect public activity only. Public indicators are also available on the GitHub Innovation Graph. For country-level reporting there, we publish metrics only when \u2265100 unique developers performed the activity in the period.\\nTime windows\\nMonthly snapshots: Calendar-month metrics to show peaks/turning points (e.g., Aug 2025 language rankings).\\nTrailing-12-month (T12): Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925 vs Sep \u201923\u2013Aug \u201924 for year-over-year trends/averages.\\nLonger lookbacks: Historical context from Jan 2022 \u2192 Aug 2025 where relevant.\\nUnits & entities\\nContributors/developers: Monthly unique users per metric (e.g., per language). One user can appear in multiple categories in the same month, so these do not sum across categories.\\nRepositories: Counted in a month if created or active, per metric definition.\\nActivities: \u201cpushes,\u201d \u201cpull requests created/merged,\u201d \u201ccomments,\u201d etc., follow standard GitHub event definitions.\\nGrowth baselines\\nSame-month YoY: Month vs. the same month prior year (e.g., Aug \u201925 vs Aug \u201924) are used for milestones/seasonality control as in language comparisons.\\nT12 YoY: Trailing-12-month total or average vs the prior trailing-12-month metric are used for sustained trends (e.g., average monthly contributors, pull requests per month).\\nStock vs. flow (cumulative metrics): Stock = level at a point in time (e.g., SDK repos as of Aug \u201925). Flow = adds over a window (e.g., Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925). Labeled distinctly.\\nGeography\\nDevelopers are mapped to countries via self-reported locations, standardized to ISO country codes; country aggregates observe the \u2265100 developers publication threshold.\\nRepository & language classification\\nPrimary language: GitHub language detection (e.g., Linguist); mixed-language repositories are attributed to one primary language.\\nNotebooks: \u201cJupyter Notebook\u201d is a development-environment classification and is labeled transparently.\\nAI projects: Identified via signals such as generative-AI SDK usage (imports/dependencies) and related metadata.\\nOpen source quality signals: Presence of files/policies (e.g., codes of conduct) from repository metadata.\\nStatistical techniques\\nMonthly time-series tracking; cumulative counts for stock growth; Top-N rankings (contributors, repo counts, growth rates, activity volumes).\\nMinimum thresholds to reduce noise (e.g., lists may require \u22651,000 contributors or \u2265X repos; metric-specific).\\nUser de-duplication\\nCount unique users per time period and per metric to avoid within-slice double counting; cross-category duplication is expected by design.\\nData quality controls\\nExclude incomplete months (e.g., the current month) from YoY/T12.\\nFilter bots/automation where identifiable (account flags + behavioral heuristics).\\nEnforce minimum activity for inclusion in growth and rankings.\\nCross-validate against multiple internal/public sources (e.g., Innovation Graph).\\nInterpretation & reproducibility\\nSeasonality: motivates same-month YoY for snapshots and T12 for structure.\\nAttribution: primary language is repository-level; TypeScript/JavaScript mixes may appear under one language.\\nScope: public-only views undercount private activity but preserve directionality.\\nPublic counterparts for several metrics can be verified via the Innovation Graph.\\nDeveloper growth projections\\nForecasting models: a collection of time-series and regression models that use historical data and statistics to predict future outcomes. Forecasting models relied on historical GitHub data, sign-up rates and product usage, as well as market-sizing information.\xa0\\nAccuracy of forecasts: No forecast is ever accurate. Backtesting shows models used for forecasting growth projections were within reasonable levels of accuracy (less than 30% Mean Absolute Percentage Error).\\nExternal factors: Forecasts do not take into account competitive landscape changes, geopolitical/economic conditions, or future covariates (product/feature releases that may shift responses differently from historical data).\\n\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"GitHub Staff","description":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91454","categories":["News & insights","Octoverse"],"isoDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1","publishedDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","author":"GitHub Staff","summary":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Jamie Cooper","title":"Announcing the 2025 GitHub Partner Award winners \ud83c\udf89","link":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-the-2025-github-partner-award-winners/","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\\">\\n<html><body><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-moving tech industry, partnerships are a powerful engine for scale.

The cereal is scattered across three aisles. The milk is hiding in some random cooler near self-checkout. And those produce labels? They haven\u2019t been updated in months.\\nThat\u2019s exactly what discovering Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers felt like. Until now.\\nAs a refresher, MCP is how developers connect tools, APIs, and workflows to their AI systems. Each MCP server is like an ingredient in your AI stack, whether it\u2019s Playwright for browser automation, Notion for knowledge access, or GitHub\u2019s own MCP server with over a hundred tools.\xa0\\nThe new GitHub MCP Registry changes everything by giving you a single, canonical source for discovering, installing, and managing MCP servers right on GitHub.\\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about finding the right tools for your AI stack, publishing your own servers, and setting up governance for your team.\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll walk through how to:\\nInstall an MCP server\\nPublish your own\\nEnable governance and team use\\nWe\u2019ll also share a few tips and tricks for power users. Let\u2019s go!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\u2019s in the registry today\\nCurrently, the GitHub MCP Registry has 44 MCP servers, including:\\nPlaywright: Automate and test web apps.\\nGitHub MCP server: Access 100+ GitHub API tools.\\nContext7, MarkItDown (Microsoft), Terraform (HashiCorp).\\nPartner servers from Notion, Unity, Firecrawl, Stripe, and more.\\nYou can browse by tags, popularity, or GitHub stars to find the tools you need.\\nHow to install an MCP server\\nThe registry makes installation a one-click experience in VS Code or VS Code Insiders.\\nExample: Installing Playwright\\nNavigate to Playwright MCP server in the GitHub MCP Registry.\\nClick Install in VS Code.\\nVS Code launches with a pre-filled configuration.\\nAccept or adjust optional parameters (like storage paths).\\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready to use Playwright in your agentic workflows.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Remote MCP servers (like GitHub\u2019s) use OAuth during install so you don\u2019t need to manually handle tokens or secrets. Just authenticate once and start building.\\nHow to publish your own MCP server\\n1. Install the MCP Publisher CLI\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (Homebrew, recommended):\\nbrew install mcp-publisher\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (prebuilt binary, latest version):\\n\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher && sudo mv mcp-publisher /usr/local/bin/\\n2. Initialize your server.json file\\nNavigate to your server\u2019s source directory and run:\\ncd /path/to/your/mcp-server\\nmcp-publisher init\\nThis creates a server.json file. Example:\\n{\\n  \\"$schema\\": \\"https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-09-29/server.schema.json\\",\\n  \\"name\\": \\"io.github.yourname/your-server\\",\\n  \\"title\\": \\"Describe Your Server\\",\\n  \\"description\\": \\"A description of your MCP server\\",\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n  \\"packages\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"registryType\\": \\"npm\\",\\n      \\"identifier\\": \\"your-package-name\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n      \\"transport\\": { \\"type\\": \\"stdio\\" }\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n3. Prove you own the package\\nAdd the required metadata for your package type.\\nNPM: Add an \\"mcpName\\" field to your package.json:\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"your-npm-package\\",\\n  \\"mcpName\\": \\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n}\\nPyPI/NuGet: Add this to your README:\\nmcp-name: io.github.username/server-name\\nDocker: Add a label to your Dockerfile:\\nLABEL io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name=\\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n4. Authentication\\nFor GitHub-based namespaces (io.github.*), run:\\nmcp-publisher login github\\n       This will open a browser for OAuth login.\\nFor custom domains (com.yourcompany/*), follow DNS verification steps in the official docs.\\n5. Publish your server\\nOnce authenticated, publish to the registry:\\nmcp-publisher publish\\nIf successful, your server will be discoverable in the MCP registry.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-72438\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png\\" alt=\\"Image credit: vxdb\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"415\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png 1421w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-768x425.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-782x433.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /></p>\\n<p>First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> &#8212; the biggest attack that <strong>Google</strong> had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p>\\n<p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote <strong>Roland Dobbins</strong>, principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>, in a recent <a href=\\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p>\\n<p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;<strong>residential proxy</strong>&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-31323\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"631\\" height=\\"264\\" /></p>\\n<p>From a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>\\n<p>And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH</h2>\\n<p><strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> is co-founder of <a href=\\"https://spur.us\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:</p>\\n<p>AUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097<br />\\nRAYOBYTE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 43,894<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa043,008<br />\\nWEBSHARE_PROXY\xa0 \xa039,800<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 32,723<br />\\nPROXYCHEAP_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,368<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,202<br />\\nMYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY\xa0 25,287<br />\\nHYPE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 18,185<br />\\nMASSIVE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 17,152</p>\\n<p>Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;</p>\\n<p>LUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421<br />\\nNETNUT_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 10,982,458<br />\\nABCPROXY_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 9,294,419<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa06,754,790<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa03,209,313<br />\\nEARNFM_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,659,913<br />\\nNODEMAVEN_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,627,851<br />\\nINFATICA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,335,194<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,032,027<br />\\nYILU_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 1,549,155<span id=\\"more-72424\\"></span></p>\\n<p>Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bright Data</strong> was formerly known as <strong>Luminati Networks</strong>, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said <strong>Rony Shalit</strong>, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and <a href=\\"https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a robust opt-in only residential peers</a>, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>HK NETWORK</h2>\\n<p>Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.</p>\\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\\"https://synthient.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Synthient</a>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own <strong>software development kit</strong> or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is <em>forced to install</em> some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p>\\n<p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.</p>\\n<p>Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy service is <strong>IPidea</strong>, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include <strong>ABCProxy </strong>(#3), <strong>Roxlabs</strong>, <strong>LunaProxy</strong>, <strong>PIA S5 Proxy</strong>, <strong>PyProxy</strong>, <strong>922Proxy</strong>, <strong>360Proxy</strong>, <strong>IP2World</strong>, and <strong>Cherry Proxy.\xa0</strong>Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said they also track <strong>Yilu Proxy\xa0</strong>(#10) as IPidea.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &#8220;<strong>HK Network</strong>.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The way it works is there&#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'&#8221; Brundage explained. &#8220;But they&#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&#8221;</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72441\\" style=\\"width: 760px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72441\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"517\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png 1126w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-768x529.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-782x539.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-100x70.png 100w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\" /></a><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72441\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies.

In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-deep-dive-into-the-residential-proxy-service-911/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China</a>.

That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p>\\n<p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqleft\\">&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said.</span> &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p>\\n<p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">report</a> earlier this year from <strong>LibreNews</strong> found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">pay-per-crawl</a>&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, but it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p>\\n<p>On October 22, the social media and news network <strong>Reddit</strong> <a href=\\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Denas Grybauskas</strong>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p>\\n<p>In July 2025, Google filed <a href=\\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME</h2>\\n<p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name <strong>fuckbriankrebs[.]com</strong>. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; and was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>\\n<p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72457\\" style=\\"width: 745px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72457 \\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"735\\" height=\\"707\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.\\n\\nFirst identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru\u2019s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.\\nIn June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second \u2014 the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru\u2019s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second \u2014 well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.\\nThese digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.\\n\u201cMultiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. \u201cOutbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.\u201d\\nThe incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru\u2019s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world\u2019s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.\\nExperts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else\u2019s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.\\n\\nFrom a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.\\nAnd as we\u2019ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.\\n\u2018INSANE\u2019 GROWTH\\nRiley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months \u2014 with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.\\n\u201cI just checked, and in the last 90 days we\u2019ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cThat is insane. That is so high of a number, it\u2019s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.\u201d\\nTo put Kilmer\u2019s comments in perspective, here was Spur\u2019s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:\\nAUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097\\nToday, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;\\nLUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421\\n\\nReached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur\u2019s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\\nBright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur\u2019s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur\u2019s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.\\n\u201cWe did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data\u2019s in some way,\u201d said Rony Shalit, Bright Data\u2019s chief compliance and ethics officer. \u201cIn many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.\u201d\\n\u201cOur network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,\u201d Shalit continued. \u201cEvery DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.\u201d\\nHK NETWORK\\nEven Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.\\nBenjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it\u2019s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What\u2019s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.\\nBrundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user\u2019s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.\\n\u201cProxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.\u201d\\nMany SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.\\nDepending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time \u2014 all maintained through other means, Brundage said.\\n\u201cOften, you\u2019ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.\u201d\\nSome proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider\u2019s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he\u2019d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.\\nBrundage says that by almost any measurement, the world\u2019s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur\u2019s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.\xa0Spur\u2019s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy\xa0(#10) as IPidea.\\nBrundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as \u201cHK Network.\u201d\\n\u201cThe way it works is there\u2019s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, \u2018Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we\u2019ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'\u201d Brundage explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.\u201d\\n\\nA graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.\\n\\nThose apps include a range of low-cost and \u201cfree\u201d virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user\u2019s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.\\n\u201cThey have all this bandwidth to offload,\u201d Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. \u201cAnd they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.\u201d\\nOne of IPidea\u2019s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy\u2019s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company\u2019s servers were massively hacked.\\nThat 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.\\n\\nThe website for 922Proxy.\\n\\nDATA SCRAPING FOR AI\\nIn recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimate benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That\u2019s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to block, because there\u2019s a risk of blocking real people,\u201d Spur\u2019s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.\\nKilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.\\n\u201cWeb crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cEverybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.\u201d\\nKilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.\\n\u201cWhere the cost of data is out of reach \u2014 there is some exclusivity or reason they can\u2019t access the data \u2014 they\u2019ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,\u201d Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.\\nAggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.\\nCloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company\u2019s \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d feature is currently in a private beta, but it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.\\nOn October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.\\n\u201cRecognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThey do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.\u201d\\nDenas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.\\n\u201cReddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,\u201d Grybauskas said in a written statement. \u201cOxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.\u201d\\nAs big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.\\nIn July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet\u2019s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet \u201ccompromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android\u2019s open-source software, which lacks Google\u2019s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.\u201d\\nA FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME\\nBrundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate \u201cscrew you\u201d to this site\u2019s author: One of the botnet\u2019s alleged partners goes by the handle \u201cForky,\u201d and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nBrundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru\u2019s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a \u201ckill switch\u201d capable of disrupting the botnet\u2019s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.\\n\\nA tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.\\n\\nFor one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d for the security intelligence company Seralys.\\nCaturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.\\nBut even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.\\n\u201cThe bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,\u201d he said. \u201cSo anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.\u201d\\n\\nCaturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.\\n\\nThe domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was used to spread malicious software by the Cutwail spam botnet. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by Russkill (a.k.a. \u201cDirt Jumper\u201d).\\nDomaintools.com finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to David \u201cAbdilo\u201d Crees, a 27-year-old Australian man sentenced in May 2025 to time served for cybercrime convictions related to the Lizard Squad hacking group.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/#comments","description":"Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic.

I love a good caper, and have (like <a href=\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/opinion/louvre-heist-internet-thrill.html\\">many others</a>) eagerly followed the <a href=\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/louvre-museum-robbery-thieves-stolen-jewellery\\">details</a>. An electric ladder to a second-floor window, an angle grinder to get into the room and the display cases, security guards there more to protect patrons than valuables&#8212;seven minutes, in and out.</p>\\n<p>There were <a href=\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/praise-louvre-heist/684677/\\">security lapses</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The Louvre, it turns out&#8212;at least certain nooks of the ancient former palace&#8212;is something like an anopticon: a place where no one is observed. The world now knows what the four thieves (two burglars and two accomplices) realized as recently as last week: The museum&#8217;s Apollo Gallery, which housed the stolen items, was monitored by a single outdoor camera angled away from its only exterior point of entry, a balcony. In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world&#8217;s most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space. There is no surveillance footage of the break-in.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Professional jewelry thieves were not impressed with the four.

investigation by Bellingcat has identified yet another Russian-flagged bulk carrier, Irtysh (IMO: 9664976), operating in defiance of <a href=\\"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/eu-and-world/sanctions-restrictive-measures/sanctions-adopted-following-russias-military-aggression-against-ukraine_en\\">Western sanctions</a> by exporting grain from occupied Crimea to Houthi-controlled Yemen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/08/21/russias-ghost-ships-and-the-evolution-of-a-grain-smuggling-operation/\\">same pattern of deceptive methods</a> used by other vessels involved in what <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/12/18/ukraine-outraged-at-yemen-grain-shipment-from-occupied-crimea/\\">Ukraine describes as \u201cgrain theft,</a>\u201d Irtysh disabled its location tracking en route to and from the Port of Sevastopol. The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The majority of UN member states have repeatedly <a href=\\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/a_es-11_l.1_e.pdf\\">voted against Russia\u2019s invasion</a> of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, experts have previously <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/07/12/houthi-controlled-port-receives-vessel-from-occupied-crimea-after-un-inspection-body-grants-clearance/\\">highlighted to Bellingcat</a> that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bellingcat mapped Irtysh&#8217;s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd&#8217;s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: <a

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

After ten years of war, the UNHCR reports that tens of thousands of people in Yemen are living in famine-like conditions, with a further five million people experiencing food insecurity.\\nUNVIM confirmed to Bellingcat that the Irtysh was inspected \u201cin line with UNVIM operational protocols\u201d on Sept. 7 and cleared by the Saudi-led coalition Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Cell (EHOC) \u2013 a body entirely separate from the UN \u2013 on Sept. 8.\\nAsked whether UNVIM was aware the vessel had picked up grain from a port under Western sanctions, the agency replied: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-bellingcat-donate-block\\"><div><div class=\\"wp-block-image alignleft\\">\\n<figure class=\\"is-resized\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/05/question-mark.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"27\\" height=\\"27\\"/></div></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Support Bellingcat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\\">\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-button\\"><a class=\\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\\" href=\\"https://bellingcat.com/donate?utm_campaign=article_cta\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Donate</a></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Denis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was <a href=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\">poisoned</a> by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.</p>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"wp-block-image\\">\\n<figure class=\\"aligncenter size-full\\"><div class=\\"media\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"600\\" height=\\"978\\" src=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-49959\\" srcset=\\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi.jpg 600w, https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Pakhomi-184x300.jpg 184w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\" /></div><figcaption class=\\"wp-element-caption\\"><em>Vladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by <em>Monika Pakhomi (left) </em>on Nov. 8, 2019.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak.

An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.\xa0\xa0\\nWildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday, Sept. 27. After days of extensive burning, the government deployed 500 troops to the region the following day.\\n\\nEtosha National Park \u2013\xa0 SWIR Band Imagery, Sept. 20, 25, 27 and 30. Source: Copernicus \xa0\\nOptical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km\xb2 was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park\u2019s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows the main wildfire rapidly spreading north and east. The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left). Bottom \u2013\xa0 YouTube video from 2023. Both geolocated to Ozonjuitji m\u2019Bari, as tagged in Google Maps.\\nThree termite mounds are visible in both the photographer\u2019s image of the burned elephant posted to Facebook and in a 2023 YouTube video filmed in Etosha Park. Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.\\nPrime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare posted on Facebook on Sept.29, stating, \u201cAll fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.\u201d The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage.

Source: Facebook, TV Paju\xe7ara / YouTube\\nAn Australian pilot who recently died when his small plane crashed in South America during a failed drug run has links to an alleged Kinahan cartel associate who is facing charges over the importation of a multimillion dollar cocaine shipment to Western Australia.\\nThe body of former Melbourne stockbroker Timothy James Clark was reportedly found at the wreckage of his single-engine Sling 4 in Brazil\u2019s north-east on September 14, along with about 200kg of cocaine. \\n\\nLeft: the wreckage of the small aircraft in a sugarcane field in Coruripe; Timothy Clark\u2019s drivers licence. Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann. Top left: The Overlander Airport, where he allegedly met an aircraft on Dec 27, 2024. Bottom left: cocaine seized by the AFP. Right: Herrmann after he was detained. Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.

A source told the newspaper that Clark replaced the engine at least once in Brazil, indicating he was continuously flying it long-haul, and may have fitted a third engine due to the number of flying hours he was accumulating.\xa0\\nClark\u2019s plane crashed about an 11-hour flight from the Amazon basin, a region that has become a major trafficking route for cocaine bound for Europe, the drug\u2019s fastest-expanding market.\xa0\\n\\nThe wreckage of Clark\u2019s plane, which crashed earlier this month in Coruripe on the southern coast of the Brazilian state of Alagoas.

The move follows similar strategies by Perplexity and Google, which both provided free access to premium AI features in India recently to attract users. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perplexity partnered with Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to the telecom operator&#8217;s 360 million subscribers, while Google introduced a free one-year AI Pro plan for students.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-battle-lines-drawn\\">Battle lines drawn</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The numbers tell the story. In the second quarter of 2025, Perplexity&#8217;s downloads in India surged 600% year-on-year to 2.8 million, while OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT saw a 587% increase, reaching 46.7 million downloads. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, ChatGPT maintains a significant lead in absolute numbers, with 19.8 million monthly active users, versus 3.7 million for Perplexity. The ChatGPT Go programme answers an insight from the market. Launched in India in August, the tier was developed following user feedback calling for more affordable access to ChatGPT&#8217;s advanced features. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In its first month, the number of paid ChatGPT subscribers in India more than doubled, demonstrating strong product-market fit. Following the response, OpenAI expanded ChatGPT Go to nearly 90 countries worldwide.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-what-marketers-should-know\\">What marketers should know</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ChatGPT Go delivers substantial value. The plan provides higher message limits, more image generation, longer memory, and the ability to upload more files and images. At the standard pricing of less than US$5 per month, the 12-month giveaway represents a serious customer acquisition investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, stated: &#8220;Since initially launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we&#8217;ve seen from our users has been inspiring. Ahead of our first DevDay Exchange event in India, we&#8217;re making ChatGPT Go freely available for a year to help more people across India easily access and benefit from advanced AI&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The retention play is equally smart. Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers in India will also be eligible for the free 12-month promotion, preventing churn while rewarding early adopters \u2013 a lesson in lifetime value economics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-distribution-playbook\\">The distribution playbook</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>India has over 700 million smartphone users and more than a billion internet subscribers, creating unprecedented scale for digital products. Unlike competitors relying on telecom partnerships, OpenAI&#8217;s direct-to-consumer approach builds first-party relationships with users \u2013 a valuable asset for long-term monetisation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Professor Payal Arora of Utrecht University <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"https://restofworld.org/2025/google-perplexity-ai-search-india/\\">said</a> that India serves as a &#8220;high-pressure testing ground,&#8221; and a source of training data sets. Training AI on vast Indian data sets pushes models to handle linguistic diversity, low-resource contexts, and noisy real-world data, something that makes them more robust, globally.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-three-marketing-lessons\\">Three marketing lessons</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The initiative offers clear takeaways for marketing professionals. First, OpenAI is sacrificing short-term revenue for market position \u2013 a classic land-grab in winner-take-most digital markets. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Secondly, synchronising the offer with DevDay Exchange creates compound marketing value through ecosystem momentum. Thirdly, extending benefits to existing subscribers demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of customer lifetime value.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI positioned the promotion as &#8220;a continuation of OpenAI&#8217;s &#8216;Indiafirst&#8217; commitment and supports the IndiaAI Mission, reinforcing the growing momentum around AI in India as the country prepares to host the AI Impact Summit next year&#8221; \u2013 a strategic alignment with national priorities that strengthens the company&#8217;s geopolitical positioning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-monetisation-challenge\\">The monetisation challenge</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Monetising India&#8217;s large user base remains challenging, with consumers notoriously price-sensitive. Yet the scale opportunity is enormous. Converting even a small fraction of free users to paid subscribers after the promotional period could justify the acquisition cost through lifetime value, particularly as AI embeds itself deeper into professional workflows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-what-this-means\\">What this means</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI&#8217;s announcement signals that AI platform wars have entered a decisive phase where user acquisition at scale trumps immediate monetisation. For marketing professionals, the lesson is clear: in transformative technology markets, aggressive distribution and ecosystem building matter more than traditional margin optimisation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As AI capabilities commoditise, winners will be determined by who captures user habits and builds the\xa0strongest\xa0network effects first.\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-argues-against-chatgpt-data-deletion-in-indian-court/\\">OpenAI argues against ChatGPT data deletion in Indian court</a></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\\"><img decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"728\\" height=\\"90\\" src=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"wp-image-110044\\" srcset=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9-300x37.png 300w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\" /></a></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out<a href=\\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer noopener\\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

In the second quarter of 2025, Perplexity\u2019s downloads in India surged 600% year-on-year to 2.8 million, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT saw a 587% increase, reaching 46.7 million downloads. \\nHowever, ChatGPT maintains a significant lead in absolute numbers, with 19.8 million monthly active users, versus 3.7 million for Perplexity. The ChatGPT Go programme answers an insight from the market. Launched in India in August, the tier was developed following user feedback calling for more affordable access to ChatGPT\u2019s advanced features. \\nIn its first month, the number of paid ChatGPT subscribers in India more than doubled, demonstrating strong product-market fit. Following the response, OpenAI expanded ChatGPT Go to nearly 90 countries worldwide.\\nWhat marketers should know\\nChatGPT Go delivers substantial value. The plan provides higher message limits, more image generation, longer memory, and the ability to upload more files and images. At the standard pricing of less than US$5 per month, the 12-month giveaway represents a serious customer acquisition investment.\\nNick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, stated: \u201cSince initially launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we\u2019ve seen from our users has been inspiring. Ahead of our first DevDay Exchange event in India, we\u2019re making ChatGPT Go freely available for a year to help more people across India easily access and benefit from advanced AI\u201d.\\nThe retention play is equally smart. Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers in India will also be eligible for the free 12-month promotion, preventing churn while rewarding early adopters \u2013 a lesson in lifetime value economics.\\nThe distribution playbook\\nIndia has over 700 million smartphone users and more than a billion internet subscribers, creating unprecedented scale for digital products. Unlike competitors relying on telecom partnerships, OpenAI\u2019s direct-to-consumer approach builds first-party relationships with users \u2013 a valuable asset for long-term monetisation.\\nProfessor Payal Arora of Utrecht University said that India serves as a \u201chigh-pressure testing ground,\u201d and a source of training data sets. Training AI on vast Indian data sets pushes models to handle linguistic diversity, low-resource contexts, and noisy real-world data, something that makes them more robust, globally.\\nThree marketing lessons\\nThe initiative offers clear takeaways for marketing professionals. First, OpenAI is sacrificing short-term revenue for market position \u2013 a classic land-grab in winner-take-most digital markets. \\nSecondly, synchronising the offer with DevDay Exchange creates compound marketing value through ecosystem momentum. Thirdly, extending benefits to existing subscribers demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of customer lifetime value.\\nOpenAI positioned the promotion as \u201ca continuation of OpenAI\u2019s \u2018Indiafirst\u2019 commitment and supports the IndiaAI Mission, reinforcing the growing momentum around AI in India as the country prepares to host the AI Impact Summit next year\u201d \u2013 a strategic alignment with national priorities that strengthens the company\u2019s geopolitical positioning.\\nThe monetisation challenge\\nMonetising India\u2019s large user base remains challenging, with consumers notoriously price-sensitive. Yet the scale opportunity is enormous. Converting even a small fraction of free users to paid subscribers after the promotional period could justify the acquisition cost through lifetime value, particularly as AI embeds itself deeper into professional workflows.\\nWhat this means\\nOpenAI\u2019s announcement signals that AI platform wars have entered a decisive phase where user acquisition at scale trumps immediate monetisation. For marketing professionals, the lesson is clear: in transformative technology markets, aggressive distribution and ecosystem building matter more than traditional margin optimisation.\\nAs AI capabilities commoditise, winners will be determined by who captures user habits and builds the\xa0strongest\xa0network effects first.\xa0\\nSee also: OpenAI argues against ChatGPT data deletion in Indian court\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Choose the right DAST tool</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first step is selecting a DAST tool that fits your team&#8217;s needs. Look for solutions that are built for automation. Key features to consider include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>CI/CD integration:</strong> The tool should offer seamless integrations with popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>API-driven:</strong> An API-first approach allows for deep customisation and control over how and when scans are triggered.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Fast scans:</strong> The tool should be optimised for speed to avoid becoming a bottleneck in the pipeline.

Providing the context upfront improves what Copilot can do and helps you find gaps, missing decisions, or project deficiencies early in the process\u2014before any code is written. Once you approve, your plan goes to Copilot to start implementing, whether that&#8217;s locally in VS Code or using an agent in the cloud.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-video\\"><video controls poster=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-11.48.00-AM.png\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VScode_PlanMode_v2.mp4\\"></video></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For even finer control, you can now create custom agents in VS Code with <strong><a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions#_use-an-agentsmd-file-experimental?utm_source=blog-day1-recap-agents-md-cta&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25\\">AGENTS.md</a></strong> files, source-controlled documents that let you set clear rules and guardrails such as \u201cprefer this logger\u201d or \u201cuse table-driven tests for all handlers.\u201d This shapes Copilot&#8217;s behavior without you re-prompting it every time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now you can rely on the new <strong><a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers?utm_source=blog-day1-recap-mcp-registry-in-vs-code-cta&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25\\">GitHub MCP Registry</a>, available directly in VS Code</strong>.

With mission control, you can choose from a fleet of agents, assign them work in parallel, and track their progress from any device.\xa0\\nWe\u2019re also providing:\xa0\\nNew branch controls that give you granular oversight over when to run CI and other checks for agent-created code.\\nIdentity features to control which agent is building the task, managing access, and policies just like you would with any other developer on your team.\\nOne-click merge conflict resolution, improved file navigation, and better code commenting capabilities.\\nNew integrations for Slack and Linear, on top of our recently announced connections for Atlassian Jira, Microsoft Teams and Azure Boards, and Raycast.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTry mission control today.\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nMission control is in VS Code, too, so you\u2019ve got a single view of all your agents running in VS Code, in the Copilot CLI, or on GitHub.\\nToday\u2019s brand new release in VS Code is all about working alongside agents on projects, and it\u2019s not surprising that great results start with a great plan. Getting the context right before a project is critical, but that same context needs to carry through into the work. Copilot already adapts to the way your team works by learning from your files and your project\u2019s culture, but sometimes you need more pointed context.\\nSo today, we\u2019re introducing Plan Mode, which works with Copilot, and asks you clarifying questions along the way, to help you to build a step-by-step approach for your task. Providing the context upfront improves what Copilot can do and helps you find gaps, missing decisions, or project deficiencies early in the process\u2014before any code is written. Once you approve, your plan goes to Copilot to start implementing, whether that\u2019s locally in VS Code or using an agent in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor even finer control, you can now create custom agents in VS Code with AGENTS.md files, source-controlled documents that let you set clear rules and guardrails such as \u201cprefer this logger\u201d or \u201cuse table-driven tests for all handlers.\u201d This shapes Copilot\u2019s behavior without you re-prompting it every time.\\nNow you can rely on the new GitHub MCP Registry, available directly in VS Code. VS Code is the only editor that supports the full MCP specification. Discover, install, and enable MCP servers like Stripe, Figma, Sentry, and others, with a single click. When your task calls for a specialist, create custom agents in GitHub Copilot with their own system prompt and tools to help you define the ways you want Copilot to work.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreased confidence and control for your team\\nAgent HQ doesn\u2019t just give you more power\u2014it gives you confidence. Ensuring code quality, understanding AI\u2019s influence on your workflow, and maintaining control over how AI interacts with your codebase and organization are essential for your team\u2019s success, and we\u2019re tackling these challenges head-on.\\nWhen it comes to code quality, the core problem is that \u201cLGTM\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean \u201cthe code is healthy.\u201d A review can pass, but can still degrade the codebase and quickly become long-term technical debt. With GitHub Code Quality, in public preview today, you\u2019ve got org-wide visibility, governance, and reporting to systematically improve code maintainability, reliability, and test coverage across every repository. Enabling it extends Copilot\u2019s security checks to look at the maintainability and reliability impact of the code that\u2019s been changed.\\nAnd we\u2019ve added a code review step into the Copilot coding agent\u2019s workflow, too, so Copilot gets an initial first-line review and addresses problems (before you even see the code).\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an organization, you need to know how Copilot is being used. So today, we\u2019re announcing the public preview of the Copilot metrics dashboard, showing Copilot\u2019s impact and critical usage metrics across your entire organization.\\nFor enterprise administrators who are managing AI access, including AI agents and MCP, we\u2019re focused on providing consistent AI controls for teams with the control plane\u2014your agent governance layer. Set security policies, audit logging, and manage access all in one place. Enterprise admins can also control which agents are allowed, define access to models, and obtain metrics about the Copilot usage in your organization.\\nFor developers, by developers\xa0\\nWe built Agent HQ because we\u2019re developers, too. We know what it\u2019s like when it feels like your tools are fighting you instead of helping you. When \u201cAI-powered\u201d ends up meaning more context-switching, more babysitting, more subscriptions, and more time explaining what you need to get the value you were promised.\xa0\\nThat ends today.\\nAgent HQ isn\u2019t about the hype of AI. It\u2019s about the reality of shipping code.\xa0 It\u2019s about bringing order and governance to this new era without compromising choice. It\u2019s about giving you the power to build faster, with more confidence, and on your terms.\\nWelcome home.

Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub</strong>. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>AI is reshaping choices, not just code. </strong>In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that&rsquo;s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And one of the biggest things in 2025? <strong>Agents are here.</strong> Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we&rsquo;re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128161; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a visual learner, we have you covered.&#128071;</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\"><div class=\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\">\\n<iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" title=\\"Octoverse 2025: AI, India, and the new #1 programming language\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"281\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-u6dUg6IJk?feature=oembed\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\\">The state&#8239;of&#8239;GitHub in&#8239;2025: A year of record growth</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1152\\" height=\\"288\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288\\" alt=\\"Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91477\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1152 1152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1024 1024w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million.

Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub\u2014over 36 million in the past year. It\u2019s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.\xa0\\nThe release of GitHub Copilot Free in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged 43.2 million pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)\u2014including a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\xa0\\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s data highlights three key shifts:\xa0\\nGenerative\u202fAI is now standard in development. More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug \u201825 vs. Aug \u201824). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn\u2019t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is reshaping choices, not just code. In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that\u2019s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? Agents are here. Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we\u2019re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s jump in.\\n\ud83d\udca1 Oh, and if you\u2019re a visual learner, we have you covered.\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state\u202fof\u202fGitHub in\u202f2025: A year of record growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\\nSo, what does \u201cmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average\u201d actually mean?\xa0\\nDevelopers are converging on GitHub. More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\xa0\\nAI adoption starts immediately. We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use GitHub Copilot within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\xa0\\nThe talent boom is geographically diverse. Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\xa0\\nGitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of Copilot Free in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub\u2019s dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\\n\\n2025\u2011YTD lensContributionsShare of totalWhat it signals\\n\\nPrivate repositories4.97B\u2248\u202f81.5%Enterprise and team\u2011level collaboration is happening on GitHub.\xa0\\nPublic repositories1.12B\u2248\u202f18.5%The volume of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey numbers\\n180M+ developers are now on GitHub\\n630M total repositories with +121M new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\\n+58M private repositories (up \u202f33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\xa0\\nOpen source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub. 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\\nDeveloper productivity: shipping more, waiting less\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following the SPACE framework (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year\u2019s data.\\nDeveloper activity reached record levels in 2025\\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\\n\\nActivity2024 monthly average2025 monthly average\\n\\nIssues closed\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4M4.25M\\nPull requests merged\u202f35M43.2M\\nCode pushes65M82.19M\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the preview of Copilot coding agent in March and the introduction of Copilot code review in April. In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\xa0\\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\\nPull requests created: +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\\nIssues created: +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\\nComments on issues/PRs: essentially flat (+0.35%)\\nComments on commits: down -27% (sharp decline)\\nThese are observational signals rather than causal claims and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks and Dockerfiles highlight two stages of modern development\\nNotebooks are now a mature tool for experimentation, while Dockerfiles are considered the bridge to reproducibility and production. In 2025, 2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY) and 1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY). This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\\n\\nRepositories in\u202f2024Repositories in\u202f2025Delta\\n\\nJupyter Notebook present\u202f1.4M2.42M\xa0+75%\\nDockerfile present\u202f875k1.9M+120%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents enter the mainstream\\nAI code\u202freview helps developers. We conducted in-depth interviews with developers about their code review process and found that 72.6% of developers who use Copilot code review said it improved their effectiveness.\xa0\\nDevelopers are using AI and agentic tools to build and share their work faster. Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\xa0\\nWhat about vibe coding?\xa0\\nOne notable trend in 2025 was \u201cvibe coding.\u201d First coined by Andrej Karparthy, vibe coding emerged as shorthand for a developer workflow that starts with an idea and jumps straight to a runnable proof-of-concept (often in a single evening, powered by AI autocompletion and copy-pastable cloud tooling).\xa0\\nIt might sound playful, but its implications are serious: if AI-assisted tools continue to lower the barrier to entry, we could see programming literacy expand dramatically. We\u2019ll be watching this space for bigger signals in the months and years to come.\\nWhere the world codes\u202fin\u202f2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last five years have redrawn not just GitHub\u2019s developer map, but also the distribution of global activity, faster than any period on record.\\nA new global top\u202f10\\nIndia added more than 5.2 million developers in 2025, which accounts for a little over 14% of GitHub\u2019s total +36 million new developers in 2025. That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\\n* Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) computed from raw counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed?\\nSignificant growth came from India, Brazil, and Indonesia. These regions combine large, young developer populations with expanding internet access and booming startup ecosystems. Many are also seeing some of the fastest growth in AI-related projects, as local companies adopt new tools to compete globally.\\nOver the past five years (from 2020 to 2025), India, Brazil, and Indonesia have more than quadrupled the number of developers on the platform; Japan and Germany have more than tripled their developer numbers; and the USA, UK, and Canada have more than doubled the number of developers on the platform.\\nBrazil, in particular, is benefiting from activity investment in fintech and open banking.\\nIndonesia continues to grow with its rise as Southeast Asia\u2019s digital powerhouse (it accounts for nearly half the region\u2019s online economy!).\\nRegional growth snapshots\\n\\nRegionStand\u2011out markets2024\u202fto \u202f2025 net new devsWhat\u2019s fueling the boom\\n\\nAPACIndia, Japan, Indonesia,\xa0+13MGovernment skilling, AI\u2011assisted local\u2011language tooling.

(You can get more information about this in our methodology section.)\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe results of our analysis suggest India will continue to expand its lead, reaching 57.5 million developers by 2030, and accounting for more than one in three of all projected sign ups worldwide. The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\\nNotably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\\nKey takeaways\\nOne in every three new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn\u2019t in the global top 10 in 2020.\\nIndia alone added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth.\\nThe AI boom is global:\u202fThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\xa0\xa0\\nOpen source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source development reached record levels this year with 1.12 billion contributions across public repositories (+13% YoY). March 2025 marked the largest single month of new open source contributors in GitHub history: 255,000 first-timers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 395 million public repositories hosted 1.12 billion contributions and 518.7 million merged pull requests\u2014each a record.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s fastest\u2011growing projects by contributors\\nSix of the 10 fastest-growing repositories were AI infrastructure projects, underscoring demand for runtimes, orchestration, and efficiency tools.\\nStandards also saw big growth: Model Context Protocol (MCP) hit 37k stars in just eight months, though it\u2019s not on our lists below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top open source projects by contributors\\n2025\u2019s top projects split between AI infrastructure (vllm, ollama, huggingface/transformers) and enduring ecosystems (vscode, godot, home-assistant).\\nOn one side, projects like vllm, ollama, ragflow, llama.cpp, and huggingface/transformers dominate, confirming that contributors are investing in the foundation layers of AI\u2014model runtimes, inference engines, and orchestration frameworks.\\nOn the other side, mainstay ecosystems such as vscode, godot, expo, and home-assistant continue to attract steady contributor bases, showing that open source momentum extends well beyond AI.\\nThe takeaway? AI infrastructure is emerging as a major magnet, but developer ecosystems remain strong.\\n\\nRankRepositoryShort description\\n\\n1vllm-project/vllmHigh-throughput LLM inference engine\\n2microsoft/vscodeWidely used open source code editor\\n3openai/codexLightweight coding agent that runs in the terminal\\n4huggingface/transformersCore library for model loading & fine-tuning\\n5godotengine/godotGame engine for 2D/3D development\\n6home-assistant/coreOpen source smart-home hub\\n7ollama/ollamaLocal model runner and management tool\\n8ggml-org/llama.cppLightweight local Llama inference\\n9volcengine/verlLLM deployment & serving framework\\n10expo/expoReact Native toolkit for mobile apps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fastest-growing projects by contributors show AI\u2019s impact along with evergreen and utility projects\\nWe see a mix of projects driving the fastest growth. zen-browser/desktop leads the pack, with fast-rising, AI-focused projects like vllm-project/vllm, continue-dev/continue, ollama/ollama, and Aider-AI/aider showing the pull of local inference, coding agents, and model runners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrowth in open source is broad. AI infrastructure projects are prominent among top-growth repositories. When we zoom out to the top 20 projects (not all of these are captured in our above graphic), we see a few things at play:\xa0\\nReproducibility and dependency hygiene are hot. The rise of astral-sh/uv and NixOS/nixpkgs points to a hunger for deterministic builds, faster installs, and less \u201cworks on my machine.\u201d\\nPerformance-centric developer tools win attention. Ghostty, Tailwind CSS, and uv are all about speed, tight feedback loops, and minimal friction.\\nDevelopers are contributing to projects that emphasize privacy and control. Zen Browser and Clash-Verge reflect interest in privacy, content control, and routing around networks.\\nOpen source social media continues to grow. As one of the biggest social projects, Bluesky\u2019s momentum suggests developers are still investing in open protocols and portable identity.\\nAI, tinkering, and frontend projects attract first-time contributors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 20% of the most popular open source projects among first-time contributors in 2025 were AI-focused. But we\u2019re also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\xa0\\nMost of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure. Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\\nMajor platforms bring visibility. microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\\nfirstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\\nSmart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers. Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d\\nFrontend and dev tool projects also light up. shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\\nAI\u2011native vs. evergreen ecosystems\\nAI podium. Six of the overall top 10 projects by total contributors are AI\u2011centric (vllm, huggingface/transformers, modelcontextprotocol/servers, llama.cpp, etc.). They averaged +150\u202f% contributor growth YoY\u2014triple the OSS median.\\nEvergreen pull. Internet of things (home\u2011assistant), game development (godotengine/godot), and the Python language itself (cpython) still add thousands of contributors per quarter.\\nThe global landscape in open source activity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia now has the largest public and open source contributor base in the world. This reflects both the country\u2019s booming developer population and its increasing role in OSS adoption.\\nThe U.S. continues to lead in contributions. Despite having fewer contributors, U.S.-based developers contributed more to public and open source projects on GitHub. This suggests higher per-developer activity.\\nBrazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier. Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\\nCommunity health: Governance isn\u2019t keeping pace with developer activity\\n\u200b\u200bGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\xa0\\nREADME reach: ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\xa0\\nContributor guides: At 5.5%, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\\nCodes of Conduct: 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They\u2019re foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration. This guide to getting your repository collaboration-ready shares what documentation is most important for fostering a sense of shared ownership.\\nKey takeaways for 2025\\n395M public and open source repositories (+19% YoY)\\n1.12B public and open source contributions (+13% YoY)\\n518.7M pull requests merged (+29% YoY)\\n60% of top 10 open source projects by contributors are AI\u2011focused\\nOnly 1\u202fin\u202f50 repositories ships with a Code of Conduct\\nSecurity: from \u201cshift left\u201d to secure\u202fby\u202fdefault\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\xa0\\nAutomation is driving this acceleration. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving common OWASP Top 10 issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\xa0\\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories (+172% YoY). Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub\u2019s engineers published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow, which offers some valuable lessons).\xa0\\nAutomation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\\nDevelopers are automating more build, test, and security activity. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That\u2019s up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year\u2019s report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\\nAutomation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy. Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\\nMonthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. Only ~1\u202fin\u202f3 fixes ships within the same month it\u2019s proposed.\\nSecurity alerts follow the same pattern: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\\nFaster fix times\\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\xa0\xa0\\nConfiguring and codifying security\\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in dependabot.yml more than doubled this year (846k, +137% YoY), marking a shift from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cpatch me automatically, within guardrails.\u201d\\n\\nSignal2024 (cumulative)2025\u202f (cumulative)YoY\\n\\nRepositories with dependabot.yml356k846k+137%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken Access Control overcame Injection to become the top CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories. New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\\nThis points to a broader issue: authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs. Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same category became the fastest-growing target for Copilot Autofix. By mid-2025, developers were accepting AI-generated fixes for Broken Access Control in 6,000+ repositories per month. Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\\nOpenSSF Scorecard status: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the OpenSSF Scorecard via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\xa0\\nThe top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\\nMethodology note\\nUnless otherwise specified, year-over-year growth rates throughout this section reflect August 2025 vs. August 2024, a same-month year-over-year comparison used to control for seasonality in monthly contributor counts.\\nTypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\\nPython remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (\u2248403k repositories; +17.8% YoY inside AI-tagged projects).\\nJavaScript is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn\u2019t just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed in 2025\\n\\nRank 2025LanguageYoY contributor gainYoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)Big takeaway\\n\\n1TypeScript~1,054,01566.63%TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development.\\n2Python~850,57948.78%Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python\u2019s usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work.\xa0\\n3JavaScript~427,14824.79%Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript.\\n4Java~174,70520.73%Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth.\\n5C#~136,735\xa022.22%Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython still trails the combined JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, a continuation of last year\u2019s trend that highlights just how large the typed and untyped JavaScript community remains.\xa0\\nBut starting in 2025, Python\u2019s growth curve began to track almost identically in parallel with JavaScript and TypeScript, suggesting that AI adoption is influencing language choice across these ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat else we\u2019re seeing\\nPython dominates AI projects. It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\\nTyped > loosely typed. TypeScript\u2019s growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as \u201cJavaScript\u201d activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\\nEnterprise stacks endure. Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\\nLegacy experiments emerge. COBOL appeared in our dataset with nearly 3,000 active developers\u2014likely driven by organizations and hobbyists creating AI-assisted tutorial repositories aimed at modernizing legacy codebases.\\nThe fastest-growing languages by percentage growth\\nThe following languages may not have the biggest developer communities behind them, but each has at least 1,000 monthly contributors and they\u2019re posting the fastest year-over-year growth rates on GitHub.\xa0\\n\\nLanguageCurrent developer countYoY %Why it\u2019s hot\\n\\nLuau>3,600>194%Luau is Roblox\u2019s scripting language and a gradually typed language, reflecting a broader industry trend toward typed flexibility.\xa0\\nTypst>3,600>108%As a modern LaTeX alternative, Typst aims to make academic and technical publishing faster, less cryptic, and more collaborative.\\nAstro>45,600>78%Astro\u2019s \u201cislands architecture\u201d and focus on shipping zero-JavaScript by default resonate with developers building fast, content-heavy sites (we added Astro to Linguist in 2021, which is our source for languages).\\nBlade>91,100>67%As Laravel\u2019s templating engine, Blade rides on Laravel\u2019s continued dominance in PHP web development.\\nTypeScript>2,600,000>67%Offering type safety for the JavaScript world, TypeScript\u2019s combination of JavaScript ubiquity and type safety is compelling for both greenfield and legacy projects (plus, its types work well with AI coding tools).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore stacks for new projects built in the last 12 months\\nNearly 80% of new repositories used just six languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and C#. These core languages anchor most modern development.\\n\\nLanguageTotal repositories (Sep 2024-Aug 2025)\xa0Growth (Jan-Aug 2025 vs. Jan-Aug 2024)\xa0What this growth tells us\\n\\nPython9,261,58753.41%AI\u2019s default glue with growth driven by ML, agents, notebooks, and orchestration.\\nJavaScript9,345,04614.57%Still ubiquitous for scripts and web apps, though growth is slower as TypeScript gains share.\\nTypeScript5,394,25678.10%Typed standard for modern web dev.

Though not a language, Jupyter Notebooks grew 24.5% YoY, with exploratory LLM experiments and data analysis now generating new standalone repos rather than remaining siloed in monorepos.\\nPerformance and systems languages are rising with AI (but not evenly). C grew ~20.9% YoY and C++ grew ~11.8% YoY, reflecting demand for faster runtimes, inference engines, and hardware-optimized loops.\\n.NET stays strong. C# grew ~10.6% YoY, consistent with enterprise and game/tooling ecosystems. This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\\nThe languages powering AI development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython and Jupyter Notebook continue to anchor new AI projects, but the story this year is Python\u2019s growth. Python now powers nearly half of all new AI repositories (582,196; +50.7% YoY), underscoring its role as the backbone of applied AI work, from training and inference to orchestration and deployment. Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for experimentation (402,643; +17.8% YoY), but the shift toward Python codebases signals more projects moving out of prototypes and into production stacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end and app-layer languages grew sharply from smaller bases\u2014TypeScript +77.9% (85,746) and JavaScript +24.8% (88,023)\u2014mirroring the rise of demos, dashboards, and lightweight apps built around model endpoints. Shell scripts (+324%) emerged as the fastest riser, reflecting how teams codify eval harnesses, data prep, and deployment pipelines. And C++ crossed 7,800 repos (+11%), a steady reminder of its role in performance-critical inference engines, runtimes, and hardware-close systems.\\nWhy TypeScript won in 2025\\nBy the numbers. TypeScript finished #1 on GitHub in August 2025 with 2,636,006 monthly contributors (+1.05M YoY; +66.6%) and led new repositories.\xa0\\nTyped contracts scale AI-assisted teams. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch LLM errors before production.\\nFrameworks ship with TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate a TypeScript codebase by default (npm create, pnpm dlx, or bunx create).\xa0\\nTyped systems help identify LLM-generated compile errors earlier in the pipeline. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures.\xa0\\nLow barrier to entry. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and IDE autoconfig hide boilerplate, so junior devs can spin up typed stacks quickly.\\nGenerative\u202fAI and agentic workflows become ordinary engineering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year we saw AI move from experiment to mainstream. In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\xa0\\nAI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million, nearly doubling in less than two years.\\nRoughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week, showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly contributors to generative-AI projects climbed sharply across our measurement year. From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan\u2013Aug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan\u2013Aug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\\nKey takeaways:\xa0\\nGenerative AI is becoming infrastructure. More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August \u201825 vs. August \u201824), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\xa0\\nGrowth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping. Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\xa0\\nAI in open source. Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using GitHub Copilot.\\nEarly evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot. Python-based code accelerated mid-2025 while Notebook growth flattened\u2014signaling packaging into production. (By year\u2019s end, Notebooks rebounded, keeping pace with Python.)\\nStrong signals of mainstream appeal\xa0\\n\\nData pointWhy it matters\\n\\n178% YoY increase in projects that import an LLM SDK1.13M+ public repositories now import an LLM SDK; 693k+ were created in the last 12 months alone.Growth rates indicate a shift from early experimentation to sustained building.\\nContributors up >3X since 2023Monthly distinct contributors to AI repos rose from 68k (Jan 2024) to ~200k (Aug 2025). August 2025 is up 111% YoY vs. August 2024.AI work is no longer the domain of specialists.\\nMonthly contributions near 6MMonthly commits/contributions to AI projects reached ~6.0M (Aug 2025) hitting a peak of 6.28M (Jun 2025). August 2025 is up 188% YoY vs. August 2024.More code, more often, offering evidence of production-grade adoption and active iteration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScale replaces hype\\n1.13M+ public repositories now depend on generative-AI SDKs (up 178% YoY). More than 693k+ were created in the last 12 months, sharply outpacing 2024\u2019s total (~400,000). The compounding curve that began in early 2023 shows no sign of tapering; every week, on average, we are still seeing new all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho\u2019s shipping the code?\\nThe U.S. remains the largest source of contributions (~12.8M, 31.8%). India ranks second (~5M, 12.5%) and leads by distinct repositories (405k vs. 342k).\\nA second tier (Germany, Japan, U.K., Korea, Canada, Brazil, Spain, France) contributes another ~40%, globalizing the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgentic tools are now being adopted in day-to-day workflows\\nThis year, GitHub Copilot coding agent went from demo to GA and we\u2019re starting to see its impact.\\nA first glimpse of coding agent shows 1+ million pull requests that were created between May 2025 and September 2025.\\nWhere it\u2019s showing up:\\nA repository-level comparison of public repositories with \u22651 coding agent-authored pull request vs. a random sample without Copilot coding agent shows strong selection effects: coding agent activity is skewed toward repositories with more stars, larger size, and greater age. In other words, teams aren\u2019t only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they\u2019re trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\xa0\\nWe invite the community to run within-repository experiments (A/B or stepped-wedge) and matched analyses conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We\u2019ll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\xa0\\nAI is driving notable breakouts in open source\\nGenerative AI projects continue to be among GitHub\u2019s most popular. Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\xa0\\n\\nRepository (age \u22643 yrs unless noted)AI connection\\n\\nvllm-project/vllmOpen source vision-language model + training/inference stack\\nggml-org/llama.cppLocal Llama inference on CPU/GPU\\ninfiniflow/ragflowEnd-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template\\ncline/cline\u201cLLM-native\u201d command-line shell that reasons over local context\\nhuggingface/transformers (6.6 yrs)Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat this tells us\\nSoftware infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity. Brand-new generative AI repositories (\u2264 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\\nStandards are emerging in real time. The rapid rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\\nAI is reshaping classic tooling. Projects like ollama and ragflow show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\\nAI is helping developers fix code, too\\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\\nBroken access control surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in 6,000+ repositories per month by mid-2025.\\nSecurity logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\\nAutofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues\u2014not just exotic vulnerabilities\u2014bringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\\nHere\u2019s how to stay ahead\\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI\u2014systems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis\u2014is emerging.\\nExpect AI libraries to become \u201cplumbing.\u201d If your stack can\u2019t load a model or pipe context into one, you\u2019ll feel legacy-bound quickly.\xa0\\nGo beyond notebooks. Package your experiments early to share them with others.\\nWatch the toolchain, not just the models. The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today\u2019s fast-rising repositories.\\nBuild for interoperability. Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\\nTake this with you\\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn\u2019t replace developers\u2014it would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\\nThe past year marked historic milestones:\xa0\\nIndia overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub. It\u2019s also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\\nTypeScript became the most used language for the first time, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\\nOpen source remains the foundation. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\\nThe story of 2025 isn\u2019t AI versus developers. It\u2019s about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\\nGlossary\\n2025: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\xa0\\nYear-over-year language comparisons: Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\\nContributions: Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\xa0\\nContributors: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\xa0\\nDeveloper: Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries\u2014from software development to data analysis and design.\\nTotal repositories: The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\\nProgramming language usage: Unless otherwise noted, \u201cmost used\u201d languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for \u201cTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.\u201d\\nAI-related repository: Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d \u201cLLM\u201d) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\\nAgentic workflows: Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\\nCopilot coding agent: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment\u2014subject to developer review and approval.\\nCopilot code review: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\\nGitHub Actions minutes: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\\nCodeQL: GitHub\u2019s semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\\nMona rank: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final \u201cMona Rank\u201d based on the summed rank.\\nLLM SDK: A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\xa0\\nMethodology\\nScope & coverage\\nOctoverse year: Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025.\\nUnless noted, metrics reflect public activity only.

The cereal is scattered across three aisles. The milk is hiding in some random cooler near self-checkout. And those produce labels? They haven\u2019t been updated in months.\\nThat\u2019s exactly what discovering Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers felt like. Until now.\\nAs a refresher, MCP is how developers connect tools, APIs, and workflows to their AI systems. Each MCP server is like an ingredient in your AI stack, whether it\u2019s Playwright for browser automation, Notion for knowledge access, or GitHub\u2019s own MCP server with over a hundred tools.\xa0\\nThe new GitHub MCP Registry changes everything by giving you a single, canonical source for discovering, installing, and managing MCP servers right on GitHub.\\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about finding the right tools for your AI stack, publishing your own servers, and setting up governance for your team.\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll walk through how to:\\nInstall an MCP server\\nPublish your own\\nEnable governance and team use\\nWe\u2019ll also share a few tips and tricks for power users. Let\u2019s go!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\u2019s in the registry today\\nCurrently, the GitHub MCP Registry has 44 MCP servers, including:\\nPlaywright: Automate and test web apps.\\nGitHub MCP server: Access 100+ GitHub API tools.\\nContext7, MarkItDown (Microsoft), Terraform (HashiCorp).\\nPartner servers from Notion, Unity, Firecrawl, Stripe, and more.\\nYou can browse by tags, popularity, or GitHub stars to find the tools you need.\\nHow to install an MCP server\\nThe registry makes installation a one-click experience in VS Code or VS Code Insiders.\\nExample: Installing Playwright\\nNavigate to Playwright MCP server in the GitHub MCP Registry.\\nClick Install in VS Code.\\nVS Code launches with a pre-filled configuration.\\nAccept or adjust optional parameters (like storage paths).\\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready to use Playwright in your agentic workflows.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Remote MCP servers (like GitHub\u2019s) use OAuth during install so you don\u2019t need to manually handle tokens or secrets. Just authenticate once and start building.\\nHow to publish your own MCP server\\n1. Install the MCP Publisher CLI\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (Homebrew, recommended):\\nbrew install mcp-publisher\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (prebuilt binary, latest version):\\n\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher && sudo mv mcp-publisher /usr/local/bin/\\n2. Initialize your server.json file\\nNavigate to your server\u2019s source directory and run:\\ncd /path/to/your/mcp-server\\nmcp-publisher init\\nThis creates a server.json file. Example:\\n{\\n  \\"$schema\\": \\"https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-09-29/server.schema.json\\",\\n  \\"name\\": \\"io.github.yourname/your-server\\",\\n  \\"title\\": \\"Describe Your Server\\",\\n  \\"description\\": \\"A description of your MCP server\\",\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n  \\"packages\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"registryType\\": \\"npm\\",\\n      \\"identifier\\": \\"your-package-name\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n      \\"transport\\": { \\"type\\": \\"stdio\\" }\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n3. Prove you own the package\\nAdd the required metadata for your package type.\\nNPM: Add an \\"mcpName\\" field to your package.json:\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"your-npm-package\\",\\n  \\"mcpName\\": \\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n}\\nPyPI/NuGet: Add this to your README:\\nmcp-name: io.github.username/server-name\\nDocker: Add a label to your Dockerfile:\\nLABEL io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name=\\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n4. Authentication\\nFor GitHub-based namespaces (io.github.*), run:\\nmcp-publisher login github\\n       This will open a browser for OAuth login.\\nFor custom domains (com.yourcompany/*), follow DNS verification steps in the official docs.\\n5. Publish your server\\nOnce authenticated, publish to the registry:\\nmcp-publisher publish\\nIf successful, your server will be discoverable in the MCP registry.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-72438\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png\\" alt=\\"Image credit: vxdb\\" width=\\"749\\" height=\\"415\\" srcset=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png 1421w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-768x425.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea-782x433.png 782w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\\" /></p>\\n<p>First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> &#8212; the biggest attack that <strong>Google</strong> had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p>\\n<p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote <strong>Roland Dobbins</strong>, principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>, in a recent <a href=\\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p>\\n<p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;<strong>residential proxy</strong>&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p>\\n<p><img decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-31323\\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"631\\" height=\\"264\\" /></p>\\n<p>From a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>\\n<p>And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH</h2>\\n<p><strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> is co-founder of <a href=\\"https://spur.us\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:</p>\\n<p>AUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097<br />\\nRAYOBYTE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 43,894<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa043,008<br />\\nWEBSHARE_PROXY\xa0 \xa039,800<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 32,723<br />\\nPROXYCHEAP_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,368<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 26,202<br />\\nMYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY\xa0 25,287<br />\\nHYPE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 18,185<br />\\nMASSIVE_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 17,152</p>\\n<p>Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;</p>\\n<p>LUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421<br />\\nNETNUT_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 10,982,458<br />\\nABCPROXY_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 9,294,419<br />\\nOXYLABS_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa06,754,790<br />\\nIPIDEA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 \xa03,209,313<br />\\nEARNFM_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,659,913<br />\\nNODEMAVEN_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,627,851<br />\\nINFATICA_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,335,194<br />\\nIPROYAL_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 2,032,027<br />\\nYILU_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 1,549,155<span id=\\"more-72424\\"></span></p>\\n<p>Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bright Data</strong> was formerly known as <strong>Luminati Networks</strong>, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said <strong>Rony Shalit</strong>, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and <a href=\\"https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a robust opt-in only residential peers</a>, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>HK NETWORK</h2>\\n<p>Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.</p>\\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\\"https://synthient.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Synthient</a>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p>\\n<p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own <strong>software development kit</strong> or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is <em>forced to install</em> some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p>\\n<p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters.

That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p>\\n<p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p>\\n<p><span class=\\"pullquote pqleft\\">&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said.</span> &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p>\\n<p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">report</a> earlier this year from <strong>LibreNews</strong> found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">pay-per-crawl</a>&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, but it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p>\\n<p>On October 22, the social media and news network <strong>Reddit</strong> <a href=\\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><strong>Denas Grybauskas</strong>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p>\\n<p>In July 2025, Google filed <a href=\\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME</h2>\\n<p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name <strong>fuckbriankrebs[.]com</strong>. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; and was <a href=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>\\n<p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_72457\\" style=\\"width: 745px\\" class=\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\"><img aria-describedby=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" decoding=\\"async\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"wp-image-72457 \\" src=\\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"735\\" height=\\"707\\" /><p id=\\"caption-attachment-72457\\" class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.\\n\\nFirst identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru\u2019s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.\\nIn June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second \u2014 the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru\u2019s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second \u2014 well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.\\nThese digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.\\n\u201cMultiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. \u201cOutbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.\u201d\\nThe incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru\u2019s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world\u2019s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.\\nExperts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else\u2019s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.\\n\\nFrom a website\u2019s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes \u2014 such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.\\nAnd as we\u2019ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.\\n\u2018INSANE\u2019 GROWTH\\nRiley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months \u2014 with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.\\n\u201cI just checked, and in the last 90 days we\u2019ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cThat is insane. That is so high of a number, it\u2019s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.\u201d\\nTo put Kilmer\u2019s comments in perspective, here was Spur\u2019s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:\\nAUPROXIES_PROXY\xa0 66,097\\nToday, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;\\nLUMINATI_PROXY\xa0 \xa0 11,856,421\\n\\nReached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur\u2019s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t systematically track other providers\u2019 figures, and we\u2019re not aware of any instances of 10\xd7 or 100\xd7 growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\\nBright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur\u2019s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur\u2019s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.\\n\u201cWe did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data\u2019s in some way,\u201d said Rony Shalit, Bright Data\u2019s chief compliance and ethics officer. \u201cIn many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.\u201d\\n\u201cOur network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,\u201d Shalit continued. \u201cEvery DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.\u201d\\nHK NETWORK\\nEven Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.\\nBenjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it\u2019s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What\u2019s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.\\nBrundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user\u2019s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.\\n\u201cProxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.\u201d\\nMany SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.\\nDepending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time \u2014 all maintained through other means, Brundage said.\\n\u201cOften, you\u2019ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.\u201d\\nSome proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider\u2019s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he\u2019d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.\\nBrundage says that by almost any measurement, the world\u2019s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur\u2019s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.\xa0Spur\u2019s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy\xa0(#10) as IPidea.\\nBrundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as \u201cHK Network.\u201d\\n\u201cThe way it works is there\u2019s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, \u2018Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we\u2019ll give you these amazing reseller prices,\'\u201d Brundage explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.\u201d\\n\\nA graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.\\n\\nThose apps include a range of low-cost and \u201cfree\u201d virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user\u2019s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.\\n\u201cThey have all this bandwidth to offload,\u201d Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. \u201cAnd they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.\u201d\\nOne of IPidea\u2019s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy\u2019s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company\u2019s servers were massively hacked.\\nThat 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.\\n\\nThe website for 922Proxy.\\n\\nDATA SCRAPING FOR AI\\nIn recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimate benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That\u2019s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to block, because there\u2019s a risk of blocking real people,\u201d Spur\u2019s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.\\nKilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.\\n\u201cWeb crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cEverybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.\u201d\\nKilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.\\n\u201cWhere the cost of data is out of reach \u2014 there is some exclusivity or reason they can\u2019t access the data \u2014 they\u2019ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,\u201d Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.\\nAggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.\\nCloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company\u2019s \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d feature is currently in a private beta, but it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.\\nOn October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.\\n\u201cRecognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google\u2019s search results instead,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThey do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.\u201d\\nDenas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.\\n\u201cReddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,\u201d Grybauskas said in a written statement. \u201cOxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs\u2019 position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.\u201d\\nAs big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.\\nIn July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet\u2019s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet \u201ccompromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android\u2019s open-source software, which lacks Google\u2019s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.\u201d\\nA FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME\\nBrundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate \u201cscrew you\u201d to this site\u2019s author: One of the botnet\u2019s alleged partners goes by the handle \u201cForky,\u201d and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nBrundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru\u2019s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a \u201ckill switch\u201d capable of disrupting the botnet\u2019s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.\\n\\nA tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.\\n\\nFor one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d for the security intelligence company Seralys.\\nCaturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.\\nBut even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.\\n\u201cThe bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,\u201d he said. \u201cSo anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.\u201d\\n\\nCaturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.\\n\\nThe domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was used to spread malicious software by the Cutwail spam botnet. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by Russkill (a.k.a. \u201cDirt Jumper\u201d).\\nDomaintools.com finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to David \u201cAbdilo\u201d Crees, a 27-year-old Australian man sentenced in May 2025 to time served for cybercrime convictions related to the Lizard Squad hacking group.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/#comments","description":"Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic.

At GitHub, we\u2019ve always worked to solve these kinds of systemic challenges\u2014by making Git accessible, code review systematic with pull requests, and automating deployment with Actions.\xa0\\nWith 180 million developers, GitHub is growing at its fastest rate ever\u2014a new developer joining every second. What\u2019s more, 80% of new developers are using Copilot in their first week. AI isn\u2019t just a tool anymore; it\u2019s an integral part of the development experience. Our responsibility is to ensure this new era of collaboration is powerful, secure, and seamlessly integrated into the workflow you already trust.\\nAt GitHub Universe, we\u2019re announcing Agent HQ, GitHub\u2019s vision for the next evolution of our platform. Agents shouldn\u2019t be bolted on. They should work the way you already work. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making agents native to the GitHub flow.\\nAgent HQ transforms GitHub into an open ecosystem that unites every agent on a single platform. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, xAI, and more will become available directly within GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo bring this vision to life, we\u2019re shipping a suite of new capabilities built on the primitives you trust. This starts with a mission control, a single command center to assign, steer, and track the work of multiple agents from anywhere. It extends to VS Code with new ways to plan and customize agent behavior. And it is backed by enterprise-grade functionality: a new generation of agentic code review, a dedicated control plane to govern AI access and agent behavior, and a metrics dashboard to understand the impact of AI on your work.\xa0\\nWe are also deeply committed to investing in our platform and strengthening the primitives you rely on every day. This new world of development is powered by that foundational work, and we look forward to sharing more updates.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s dive in.\\nIn this post\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nIncreased confidence and control for your team\\nGitHub is your Agent HQ: An open ecosystem for all agents\xa0\xa0\\nThe future is about giving you the power to orchestrate a fleet of specialized agents to perform complex tasks in parallel, not juggling a patchwork of disconnected tools or relying on a single agent. As the pioneer of asynchronous collaboration, we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to make sure these next-generation async tools just work.\xa0\\nWith Agent HQ what\u2019s not changing is just as important as what is. You\u2019re still working with the primitives you know\u2014Git, pull requests, issues\u2014and using your preferred compute, whether that\u2019s GitHub Actions or self-hosted runners. You\u2019re accessing agents through your existing paid Copilot subscription.\xa0\\nOn top of that foundation, we\u2019re opening the doors to a new world of capability. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI will be available on GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.\\nDon\u2019t want to wait? Starting this week, Copilot Pro+ users can begin working with \xa0OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders, the first of our partner agents to extend beyond its native surfaces and directly into the editor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMission control: Your command center, wherever you build\\nThe power of Agent HQ comes from mission control, a unified command center that follows you wherever you work. It\u2019s not a single destination; it\u2019s a consistent interface across GitHub, VS Code, mobile, and the CLI that lets you direct, monitor, and manage every AI-driven task. With mission control, you can choose from a fleet of agents, assign them work in parallel, and track their progress from any device.\xa0\\nWe\u2019re also providing:\xa0\\nNew branch controls that give you granular oversight over when to run CI and other checks for agent-created code.\\nIdentity features to control which agent is building the task, managing access, and policies just like you would with any other developer on your team.\\nOne-click merge conflict resolution, improved file navigation, and better code commenting capabilities.\\nNew integrations for Slack and Linear, on top of our recently announced connections for Atlassian Jira, Microsoft Teams and Azure Boards, and Raycast.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTry mission control today.\\nNew in VS Code: Plan, customize, and connect\\nMission control is in VS Code, too, so you\u2019ve got a single view of all your agents running in VS Code, in the Copilot CLI, or on GitHub.\\nToday\u2019s brand new release in VS Code is all about working alongside agents on projects, and it\u2019s not surprising that great results start with a great plan. Getting the context right before a project is critical, but that same context needs to carry through into the work. Copilot already adapts to the way your team works by learning from your files and your project\u2019s culture, but sometimes you need more pointed context.\\nSo today, we\u2019re introducing Plan Mode, which works with Copilot, and asks you clarifying questions along the way, to help you to build a step-by-step approach for your task. Providing the context upfront improves what Copilot can do and helps you find gaps, missing decisions, or project deficiencies early in the process\u2014before any code is written. Once you approve, your plan goes to Copilot to start implementing, whether that\u2019s locally in VS Code or using an agent in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor even finer control, you can now create custom agents in VS Code with AGENTS.md files, source-controlled documents that let you set clear rules and guardrails such as \u201cprefer this logger\u201d or \u201cuse table-driven tests for all handlers.\u201d This shapes Copilot\u2019s behavior without you re-prompting it every time.\\nNow you can rely on the new GitHub MCP Registry, available directly in VS Code. VS Code is the only editor that supports the full MCP specification. Discover, install, and enable MCP servers like Stripe, Figma, Sentry, and others, with a single click. When your task calls for a specialist, create custom agents in GitHub Copilot with their own system prompt and tools to help you define the ways you want Copilot to work.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreased confidence and control for your team\\nAgent HQ doesn\u2019t just give you more power\u2014it gives you confidence.

Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub</strong>. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>AI is reshaping choices, not just code. </strong>In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that&rsquo;s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And one of the biggest things in 2025? <strong>Agents are here.</strong> Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we&rsquo;re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&#128161; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a visual learner, we have you covered.&#128071;</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\"><div class=\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\">\\n<iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" title=\\"Octoverse 2025: AI, India, and the new #1 programming language\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"281\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-u6dUg6IJk?feature=oembed\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\\">The state&#8239;of&#8239;GitHub in&#8239;2025: A year of record growth</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wp-block-image size-full\\"><img data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" decoding=\\"async\\" width=\\"1152\\" height=\\"288\\" src=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288\\" alt=\\"Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).\\" class=\\"wp-image-91477\\" srcset=\\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1152 1152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?w=1024 1024w\\" sizes=\\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million.

Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in <strong>151k+ repositories (+172% YoY).</strong> Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub&rsquo;s engineers <a href=\\"https://github.blog/security/web-application-security/inside-github-how-we-hardened-our-saml-implementation/\\">published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow</a>, which offers some valuable lessons).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"automation-is-working-until-the-merge-queue-stalls\\">Automation is working (until the merge queue stalls)</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Developers are automating more build, test, and security activity.</strong> In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free.

Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub\u2014over 36 million in the past year. It\u2019s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.\xa0\\nThe release of GitHub Copilot Free in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged 43.2 million pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)\u2014including a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\xa0\\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s data highlights three key shifts:\xa0\\nGenerative\u202fAI is now standard in development. More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug \u201825 vs. Aug \u201824). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn\u2019t hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is reshaping choices, not just code. In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that\u2019s changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? Agents are here. Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we\u2019re just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\xa0\\nLet\u2019s jump in.\\n\ud83d\udca1 Oh, and if you\u2019re a visual learner, we have you covered.\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state\u202fof\u202fGitHub in\u202f2025: A year of record growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\\nSo, what does \u201cmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average\u201d actually mean?\xa0\\nDevelopers are converging on GitHub. More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\xa0\\nAI adoption starts immediately. We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use GitHub Copilot within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\xa0\\nThe talent boom is geographically diverse. Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\xa0\\nGitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of Copilot Free in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\xa0\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub\u2019s dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\\n\\n2025\u2011YTD lensContributionsShare of totalWhat it signals\\n\\nPrivate repositories4.97B\u2248\u202f81.5%Enterprise and team\u2011level collaboration is happening on GitHub.\xa0\\nPublic repositories1.12B\u2248\u202f18.5%The volume of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey numbers\\n180M+ developers are now on GitHub\\n630M total repositories with +121M new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\\n+58M private repositories (up \u202f33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\xa0\\nOpen source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub. 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\\nDeveloper productivity: shipping more, waiting less\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following the SPACE framework (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year\u2019s data.\\nDeveloper activity reached record levels in 2025\\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\\n\\nActivity2024 monthly average2025 monthly average\\n\\nIssues closed\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4M4.25M\\nPull requests merged\u202f35M43.2M\\nCode pushes65M82.19M\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the preview of Copilot coding agent in March and the introduction of Copilot code review in April. In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\xa0\\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\\nPull requests created: +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\\nIssues created: +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\\nComments on issues/PRs: essentially flat (+0.35%)\\nComments on commits: down -27% (sharp decline)\\nThese are observational signals rather than causal claims and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks and Dockerfiles highlight two stages of modern development\\nNotebooks are now a mature tool for experimentation, while Dockerfiles are considered the bridge to reproducibility and production. In 2025, 2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY) and 1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY). This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\\n\\nRepositories in\u202f2024Repositories in\u202f2025Delta\\n\\nJupyter Notebook present\u202f1.4M2.42M\xa0+75%\\nDockerfile present\u202f875k1.9M+120%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents enter the mainstream\\nAI code\u202freview helps developers.

Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\xa0\\nWhat about vibe coding?\xa0\\nOne notable trend in 2025 was \u201cvibe coding.\u201d First coined by Andrej Karparthy, vibe coding emerged as shorthand for a developer workflow that starts with an idea and jumps straight to a runnable proof-of-concept (often in a single evening, powered by AI autocompletion and copy-pastable cloud tooling).\xa0\\nIt might sound playful, but its implications are serious: if AI-assisted tools continue to lower the barrier to entry, we could see programming literacy expand dramatically. We\u2019ll be watching this space for bigger signals in the months and years to come.\\nWhere the world codes\u202fin\u202f2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last five years have redrawn not just GitHub\u2019s developer map, but also the distribution of global activity, faster than any period on record.\\nA new global top\u202f10\\nIndia added more than 5.2 million developers in 2025, which accounts for a little over 14% of GitHub\u2019s total +36 million new developers in 2025. That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\\n* Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) computed from raw counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed?\\nSignificant growth came from India, Brazil, and Indonesia. These regions combine large, young developer populations with expanding internet access and booming startup ecosystems. Many are also seeing some of the fastest growth in AI-related projects, as local companies adopt new tools to compete globally.\\nOver the past five years (from 2020 to 2025), India, Brazil, and Indonesia have more than quadrupled the number of developers on the platform; Japan and Germany have more than tripled their developer numbers; and the USA, UK, and Canada have more than doubled the number of developers on the platform.\\nBrazil, in particular, is benefiting from activity investment in fintech and open banking.\\nIndonesia continues to grow with its rise as Southeast Asia\u2019s digital powerhouse (it accounts for nearly half the region\u2019s online economy!).\\nRegional growth snapshots\\n\\nRegionStand\u2011out markets2024\u202fto \u202f2025 net new devsWhat\u2019s fueling the boom\\n\\nAPACIndia, Japan, Indonesia,\xa0+13MGovernment skilling, AI\u2011assisted local\u2011language tooling.

The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\\nNotably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\\nKey takeaways\\nOne in every three new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn\u2019t in the global top 10 in 2020.\\nIndia alone added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth.\\nThe AI boom is global:\u202fThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\xa0\xa0\\nOpen source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source development reached record levels this year with 1.12 billion contributions across public repositories (+13% YoY). March 2025 marked the largest single month of new open source contributors in GitHub history: 255,000 first-timers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 395 million public repositories hosted 1.12 billion contributions and 518.7 million merged pull requests\u2014each a record.\xa0\\nThis year\u2019s fastest\u2011growing projects by contributors\\nSix of the 10 fastest-growing repositories were AI infrastructure projects, underscoring demand for runtimes, orchestration, and efficiency tools.\\nStandards also saw big growth: Model Context Protocol (MCP) hit 37k stars in just eight months, though it\u2019s not on our lists below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top open source projects by contributors\\n2025\u2019s top projects split between AI infrastructure (vllm, ollama, huggingface/transformers) and enduring ecosystems (vscode, godot, home-assistant).\\nOn one side, projects like vllm, ollama, ragflow, llama.cpp, and huggingface/transformers dominate, confirming that contributors are investing in the foundation layers of AI\u2014model runtimes, inference engines, and orchestration frameworks.\\nOn the other side, mainstay ecosystems such as vscode, godot, expo, and home-assistant continue to attract steady contributor bases, showing that open source momentum extends well beyond AI.\\nThe takeaway?

AI infrastructure projects are prominent among top-growth repositories. When we zoom out to the top 20 projects (not all of these are captured in our above graphic), we see a few things at play:\xa0\\nReproducibility and dependency hygiene are hot. The rise of astral-sh/uv and NixOS/nixpkgs points to a hunger for deterministic builds, faster installs, and less \u201cworks on my machine.\u201d\\nPerformance-centric developer tools win attention. Ghostty, Tailwind CSS, and uv are all about speed, tight feedback loops, and minimal friction.\\nDevelopers are contributing to projects that emphasize privacy and control. Zen Browser and Clash-Verge reflect interest in privacy, content control, and routing around networks.\\nOpen source social media continues to grow. As one of the biggest social projects, Bluesky\u2019s momentum suggests developers are still investing in open protocols and portable identity.\\nAI, tinkering, and frontend projects attract first-time contributors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 20% of the most popular open source projects among first-time contributors in 2025 were AI-focused. But we\u2019re also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\xa0\\nMost of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure. Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\\nMajor platforms bring visibility. microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\\nfirstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\\nSmart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers. Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d\\nFrontend and dev tool projects also light up. shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\\nAI\u2011native vs. evergreen ecosystems\\nAI podium. Six of the overall top 10 projects by total contributors are AI\u2011centric (vllm, huggingface/transformers, modelcontextprotocol/servers, llama.cpp, etc.). They averaged +150\u202f% contributor growth YoY\u2014triple the OSS median.\\nEvergreen pull. Internet of things (home\u2011assistant), game development (godotengine/godot), and the Python language itself (cpython) still add thousands of contributors per quarter.\\nThe global landscape in open source activity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia now has the largest public and open source contributor base in the world. This reflects both the country\u2019s booming developer population and its increasing role in OSS adoption.\\nThe U.S. continues to lead in contributions. Despite having fewer contributors, U.S.-based developers contributed more to public and open source projects on GitHub. This suggests higher per-developer activity.\\nBrazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier. Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\\nCommunity health: Governance isn\u2019t keeping pace with developer activity\\n\u200b\u200bGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\xa0\\nREADME reach: ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\xa0\\nContributor guides: At 5.5%, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\\nCodes of Conduct: 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They\u2019re foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration. This guide to getting your repository collaboration-ready shares what documentation is most important for fostering a sense of shared ownership.\\nKey takeaways for 2025\\n395M public and open source repositories (+19% YoY)\\n1.12B public and open source contributions (+13% YoY)\\n518.7M pull requests merged (+29% YoY)\\n60% of top 10 open source projects by contributors are AI\u2011focused\\nOnly 1\u202fin\u202f50 repositories ships with a Code of Conduct\\nSecurity: from \u201cshift left\u201d to secure\u202fby\u202fdefault\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\xa0\\nAutomation is driving this acceleration. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving common OWASP Top 10 issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\xa0\\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories (+172% YoY). Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub\u2019s engineers published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow, which offers some valuable lessons).\xa0\\nAutomation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\\nDevelopers are automating more build, test, and security activity. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That\u2019s up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year\u2019s report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\\nAutomation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy. Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\\nMonthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. Only ~1\u202fin\u202f3 fixes ships within the same month it\u2019s proposed.\\nSecurity alerts follow the same pattern: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\\nFaster fix times\\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\xa0\xa0\\nConfiguring and codifying security\\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in dependabot.yml more than doubled this year (846k, +137% YoY), marking a shift from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cpatch me automatically, within guardrails.\u201d\\n\\nSignal2024 (cumulative)2025\u202f (cumulative)YoY\\n\\nRepositories with dependabot.yml356k846k+137%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken Access Control overcame Injection to become the top CodeQL alert, flagged in 151k+ repositories. New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\\nThis points to a broader issue: authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs. Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same category became the fastest-growing target for Copilot Autofix. By mid-2025, developers were accepting AI-generated fixes for Broken Access Control in 6,000+ repositories per month. Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\\nOpenSSF Scorecard status: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the OpenSSF Scorecard via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\xa0\\nThe top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\\nMethodology note\\nUnless otherwise specified, year-over-year growth rates throughout this section reflect August 2025 vs. August 2024, a same-month year-over-year comparison used to control for seasonality in monthly contributor counts.\\nTypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\\nPython remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (\u2248403k repositories; +17.8% YoY inside AI-tagged projects).\\nJavaScript is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn\u2019t just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat changed in 2025\\n\\nRank 2025LanguageYoY contributor gainYoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)Big takeaway\\n\\n1TypeScript~1,054,01566.63%TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development.\\n2Python~850,57948.78%Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python\u2019s usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work.\xa0\\n3JavaScript~427,14824.79%Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript.\\n4Java~174,70520.73%Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth.\\n5C#~136,735\xa022.22%Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython still trails the combined JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, a continuation of last year\u2019s trend that highlights just how large the typed and untyped JavaScript community remains.\xa0\\nBut starting in 2025, Python\u2019s growth curve began to track almost identically in parallel with JavaScript and TypeScript, suggesting that AI adoption is influencing language choice across these ecosystems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat else we\u2019re seeing\\nPython dominates AI projects. It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\\nTyped > loosely typed. TypeScript\u2019s growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as \u201cJavaScript\u201d activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\\nEnterprise stacks endure. Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\\nLegacy experiments emerge.

Though not a language, Jupyter Notebooks grew 24.5% YoY, with exploratory LLM experiments and data analysis now generating new standalone repos rather than remaining siloed in monorepos.\\nPerformance and systems languages are rising with AI (but not evenly). C grew ~20.9% YoY and C++ grew ~11.8% YoY, reflecting demand for faster runtimes, inference engines, and hardware-optimized loops.\\n.NET stays strong. C# grew ~10.6% YoY, consistent with enterprise and game/tooling ecosystems. This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\\nThe languages powering AI development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython and Jupyter Notebook continue to anchor new AI projects, but the story this year is Python\u2019s growth. Python now powers nearly half of all new AI repositories (582,196; +50.7% YoY), underscoring its role as the backbone of applied AI work, from training and inference to orchestration and deployment. Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for experimentation (402,643; +17.8% YoY), but the shift toward Python codebases signals more projects moving out of prototypes and into production stacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end and app-layer languages grew sharply from smaller bases\u2014TypeScript +77.9% (85,746) and JavaScript +24.8% (88,023)\u2014mirroring the rise of demos, dashboards, and lightweight apps built around model endpoints. Shell scripts (+324%) emerged as the fastest riser, reflecting how teams codify eval harnesses, data prep, and deployment pipelines. And C++ crossed 7,800 repos (+11%), a steady reminder of its role in performance-critical inference engines, runtimes, and hardware-close systems.\\nWhy TypeScript won in 2025\\nBy the numbers. TypeScript finished #1 on GitHub in August 2025 with 2,636,006 monthly contributors (+1.05M YoY; +66.6%) and led new repositories.\xa0\\nTyped contracts scale AI-assisted teams. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch LLM errors before production.\\nFrameworks ship with TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate a TypeScript codebase by default (npm create, pnpm dlx, or bunx create).\xa0\\nTyped systems help identify LLM-generated compile errors earlier in the pipeline. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures.\xa0\\nLow barrier to entry. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and IDE autoconfig hide boilerplate, so junior devs can spin up typed stacks quickly.\\nGenerative\u202fAI and agentic workflows become ordinary engineering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year we saw AI move from experiment to mainstream. In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\xa0\\nAI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million, nearly doubling in less than two years.\\nRoughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week, showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly contributors to generative-AI projects climbed sharply across our measurement year. From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan\u2013Aug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan\u2013Aug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\\nKey takeaways:\xa0\\nGenerative AI is becoming infrastructure. More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August \u201825 vs. August \u201824), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\xa0\\nGrowth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping. Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\xa0\\nAI in open source. Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using GitHub Copilot.\\nEarly evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot.

More than 693k+ were created in the last 12 months, sharply outpacing 2024\u2019s total (~400,000). The compounding curve that began in early 2023 shows no sign of tapering; every week, on average, we are still seeing new all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho\u2019s shipping the code?\\nThe U.S. remains the largest source of contributions (~12.8M, 31.8%). India ranks second (~5M, 12.5%) and leads by distinct repositories (405k vs. 342k).\\nA second tier (Germany, Japan, U.K., Korea, Canada, Brazil, Spain, France) contributes another ~40%, globalizing the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgentic tools are now being adopted in day-to-day workflows\\nThis year, GitHub Copilot coding agent went from demo to GA and we\u2019re starting to see its impact.\\nA first glimpse of coding agent shows 1+ million pull requests that were created between May 2025 and September 2025.\\nWhere it\u2019s showing up:\\nA repository-level comparison of public repositories with \u22651 coding agent-authored pull request vs. a random sample without Copilot coding agent shows strong selection effects: coding agent activity is skewed toward repositories with more stars, larger size, and greater age. In other words, teams aren\u2019t only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they\u2019re trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\xa0\\nWe invite the community to run within-repository experiments (A/B or stepped-wedge) and matched analyses conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We\u2019ll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\xa0\\nAI is driving notable breakouts in open source\\nGenerative AI projects continue to be among GitHub\u2019s most popular. Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\xa0\\n\\nRepository (age \u22643 yrs unless noted)AI connection\\n\\nvllm-project/vllmOpen source vision-language model + training/inference stack\\nggml-org/llama.cppLocal Llama inference on CPU/GPU\\ninfiniflow/ragflowEnd-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template\\ncline/cline\u201cLLM-native\u201d command-line shell that reasons over local context\\nhuggingface/transformers (6.6 yrs)Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat this tells us\\nSoftware infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity. Brand-new generative AI repositories (\u2264 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\\nStandards are emerging in real time. The rapid rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\\nAI is reshaping classic tooling. Projects like ollama and ragflow show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\\nAI is helping developers fix code, too\\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\\nBroken access control surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in 6,000+ repositories per month by mid-2025.\\nSecurity logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\\nAutofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues\u2014not just exotic vulnerabilities\u2014bringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\\nHere\u2019s how to stay ahead\\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI\u2014systems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis\u2014is emerging.\\nExpect AI libraries to become \u201cplumbing.\u201d If your stack can\u2019t load a model or pipe context into one, you\u2019ll feel legacy-bound quickly.\xa0\\nGo beyond notebooks. Package your experiments early to share them with others.\\nWatch the toolchain, not just the models. The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today\u2019s fast-rising repositories.\\nBuild for interoperability. Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\\nTake this with you\\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn\u2019t replace developers\u2014it would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\\nThe past year marked historic milestones:\xa0\\nIndia overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub. It\u2019s also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\\nTypeScript became the most used language for the first time, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\\nOpen source remains the foundation. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\\nThe story of 2025 isn\u2019t AI versus developers. It\u2019s about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\\nGlossary\\n2025: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\xa0\\nYear-over-year language comparisons: Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\\nContributions: Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\xa0\\nContributors: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\xa0\\nDeveloper: Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries\u2014from software development to data analysis and design.\\nTotal repositories: The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\\nProgramming language usage: Unless otherwise noted, \u201cmost used\u201d languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for \u201cTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.\u201d\\nAI-related repository: Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d \u201cLLM\u201d) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\\nAgentic workflows: Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\\nCopilot coding agent: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment\u2014subject to developer review and approval.\\nCopilot code review: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\\nGitHub Actions minutes: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\\nCodeQL: GitHub\u2019s semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\\nMona rank: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final \u201cMona Rank\u201d based on the summed rank.\\nLLM SDK: A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\xa0\\nMethodology\\nScope & coverage\\nOctoverse year: Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025.\\nUnless noted, metrics reflect public activity only. Public indicators are also available on the GitHub Innovation Graph. For country-level reporting there, we publish metrics only when \u2265100 unique developers performed the activity in the period.\\nTime windows\\nMonthly snapshots: Calendar-month metrics to show peaks/turning points (e.g., Aug 2025 language rankings).\\nTrailing-12-month (T12): Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925 vs Sep \u201923\u2013Aug \u201924 for year-over-year trends/averages.\\nLonger lookbacks: Historical context from Jan 2022 \u2192 Aug 2025 where relevant.\\nUnits & entities\\nContributors/developers: Monthly unique users per metric (e.g., per language). One user can appear in multiple categories in the same month, so these do not sum across categories.\\nRepositories: Counted in a month if created or active, per metric definition.\\nActivities: \u201cpushes,\u201d \u201cpull requests created/merged,\u201d \u201ccomments,\u201d etc., follow standard GitHub event definitions.\\nGrowth baselines\\nSame-month YoY: Month vs. the same month prior year (e.g., Aug \u201925 vs Aug \u201924) are used for milestones/seasonality control as in language comparisons.\\nT12 YoY: Trailing-12-month total or average vs the prior trailing-12-month metric are used for sustained trends (e.g., average monthly contributors, pull requests per month).\\nStock vs. flow (cumulative metrics): Stock = level at a point in time (e.g., SDK repos as of Aug \u201925). Flow = adds over a window (e.g., Sep \u201924\u2013Aug \u201925). Labeled distinctly.\\nGeography\\nDevelopers are mapped to countries via self-reported locations, standardized to ISO country codes; country aggregates observe the \u2265100 developers publication threshold.\\nRepository & language classification\\nPrimary language: GitHub language detection (e.g., Linguist); mixed-language repositories are attributed to one primary language.\\nNotebooks: \u201cJupyter Notebook\u201d is a development-environment classification and is labeled transparently.\\nAI projects: Identified via signals such as generative-AI SDK usage (imports/dependencies) and related metadata.\\nOpen source quality signals: Presence of files/policies (e.g., codes of conduct) from repository metadata.\\nStatistical techniques\\nMonthly time-series tracking; cumulative counts for stock growth; Top-N rankings (contributors, repo counts, growth rates, activity volumes).\\nMinimum thresholds to reduce noise (e.g., lists may require \u22651,000 contributors or \u2265X repos; metric-specific).\\nUser de-duplication\\nCount unique users per time period and per metric to avoid within-slice double counting; cross-category duplication is expected by design.\\nData quality controls\\nExclude incomplete months (e.g., the current month) from YoY/T12.\\nFilter bots/automation where identifiable (account flags + behavioral heuristics).\\nEnforce minimum activity for inclusion in growth and rankings.\\nCross-validate against multiple internal/public sources (e.g., Innovation Graph).\\nInterpretation & reproducibility\\nSeasonality: motivates same-month YoY for snapshots and T12 for structure.\\nAttribution: primary language is repository-level; TypeScript/JavaScript mixes may appear under one language.\\nScope: public-only views undercount private activity but preserve directionality.\\nPublic counterparts for several metrics can be verified via the Innovation Graph.\\nDeveloper growth projections\\nForecasting models: a collection of time-series and regression models that use historical data and statistics to predict future outcomes. Forecasting models relied on historical GitHub data, sign-up rates and product usage, as well as market-sizing information.\xa0\\nAccuracy of forecasts: No forecast is ever accurate. Backtesting shows models used for forecasting growth projections were within reasonable levels of accuracy (less than 30% Mean Absolute Percentage Error).\\nExternal factors: Forecasts do not take into account competitive landscape changes, geopolitical/economic conditions, or future covariates (product/feature releases that may shift responses differently from historical data).\\n\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","dc:creator":"GitHub Staff","description":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","content":"<p>In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/\\">Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://github.blog\\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\\n","contentSnippet":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.","guid":"https://github.blog/?p=91454","categories":["News & insights","Octoverse"],"isoDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","feedKey":"github-blog","feedTitle":"GitHub Blog","category":"tech","cleanTitle":"Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1","publishedDate":"2025-10-28T16:07:06.000Z","author":"GitHub Staff","summary":"In this year\u2019s Octoverse, we uncover how AI, agents, and typed languages are driving the biggest shifts in software development in more than a decade.\\nThe post Octoverse: A new developer joins GitHub every second as AI leads TypeScript to #1 appeared first on The GitHub Blog."},{"creator":"Jamie Cooper","title":"Announcing the 2025 GitHub Partner Award winners \ud83c\udf89","link":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-the-2025-github-partner-award-winners/","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\\">\\n<html><body><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-moving tech industry, partnerships are a powerful engine for scale.

Here are practical steps to integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline. For a broad overview of leading practices and current tooling, the<a href=\\"https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Dynamic_Application_Security_Testing_(DAST)\\"> OWASP DAST overview</a> offers an excellent starting point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>1. Choose the right DAST tool</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first step is selecting a DAST tool that fits your team&#8217;s needs. Look for solutions that are built for automation. Key features to consider include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>CI/CD integration:</strong> The tool should offer seamless integrations with popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>API-driven:</strong> An API-first approach allows for deep customisation and control over how and when scans are triggered.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Fast scans:</strong> The tool should be optimised for speed to avoid becoming a bottleneck in the pipeline. Some tools offer targeted scanning capabilities to test only the changed components.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Low false positives:</strong> A high volume of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. Choose a tool known for its accuracy to ensure your team focuses on real threats.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in real-world implementations, the<a href=\\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/integrating-dynamic-application-security-testing-into-ci-cd-pipelines\\"> Google Cloud blog on integrating DAST in CI/CD</a> breaks down how large engineering teams approach DAST automation at enterprise scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Integrate into your CI/CD pipeline</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you have a tool, the next step is to integrate it. A common approach is to add a DAST scanning stage to your pipeline. Here&#8217;s a typical workflow:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Build:</strong> The CI server pulls the latest code and builds the application.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Deploy to staging:</strong> The application is automatically deployed to a dedicated testing or staging environment. The environment should mirror production as closely as possible.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Trigger DAST scan:</strong> The CI pipeline triggers the DAST tool via an API call or a pre-built plugin. The tool then scans the running application in the staging environment.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Analyse results:</strong> The pipeline waits for the scan to complete. You can configure rules to automatically fail the build if important or high-severity vulnerabilities are found.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Report and remediate:</strong> Scan results are pushed to developers through integrated ticketing systems (like Jira or Linear) or directly in their Git platform. The provides immediate, actionable feedback.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Start small and iterate</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to automate everything at once. Begin with one or two important applications. Use this initial implementation to learn and fine-tune the process. Configure the scanner to look for a limited set of high-impact vulnerabilities, like the OWASP Top 10.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As your team becomes more comfortable with the workflow, you can expand the scope of the scans and roll out the automation to more applications. The iterative approach minimises disruption and helps build momentum.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Optimise scans for the pipeline</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A full DAST scan can take hours, which is too long for a typical CI/CD pipeline. To avoid delays, optimise your scanning strategy:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Incremental scans:</strong> Configure scans to test only the parts of the application that have changed since the last build.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Targeted scans:</strong> Focus scans on specific vulnerability classes that are most relevant to your application.<br></li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous scans:</strong> For more comprehensive scans, run them asynchronously (out-of-band) from the main CI/CD pipeline. For example, you can trigger a nightly scan on the staging environment. The results can be reviewed the next day without blocking deployments.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\"height:15px\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" class=\\"wp-block-spacer\\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"h-the-future-is-automated\\">The future is automated</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a world where software is constantly evolving, security must keep pace. Manual DAST scanning is a relic of a slower era of software development. It creates bottlenecks, lacks scalability, and places an unnecessary burden on engineering teams.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By automating DAST and integrating it into the CI/CD pipeline, you transform security from a barrier into an enabler. It allows your team to build and deploy secure software quickly and confidently. For any engineering or DevOps professional looking to enhance their organisation&#8217;s security posture without sacrificing speed, automating DAST is no longer just a best practice \u2013 it&#8217;s a necessity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Image source: Unsplash</em></p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/the-engineers-guide-to-automating-dast-tools/\\">The engineer&#8217;s guide to automating DAST tools</a> appeared first on <a href=\\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com\\">AI News</a>.</p>\\n","content:encodedSnippet":"In modern software development, speed and security must go hand in hand.

Here are practical steps to integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline. For a broad overview of leading practices and current tooling, the OWASP DAST overview offers an excellent starting point.\\n1. Choose the right DAST tool\\nThe first step is selecting a DAST tool that fits your team\u2019s needs. Look for solutions that are built for automation. Key features to consider include:\\nCI/CD integration: The tool should offer seamless integrations with popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPI-driven: An API-first approach allows for deep customisation and control over how and when scans are triggered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast scans: The tool should be optimised for speed to avoid becoming a bottleneck in the pipeline. Some tools offer targeted scanning capabilities to test only the changed components.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow false positives: A high volume of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. Choose a tool known for its accuracy to ensure your team focuses on real threats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you\u2019re interested in real-world implementations, the Google Cloud blog on integrating DAST in CI/CD breaks down how large engineering teams approach DAST automation at enterprise scale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Integrate into your CI/CD pipeline\\nOnce you have a tool, the next step is to integrate it. A common approach is to add a DAST scanning stage to your pipeline. Here\u2019s a typical workflow:\\nBuild: The CI server pulls the latest code and builds the application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeploy to staging: The application is automatically deployed to a dedicated testing or staging environment. The environment should mirror production as closely as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrigger DAST scan: The CI pipeline triggers the DAST tool via an API call or a pre-built plugin. The tool then scans the running application in the staging environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyse results: The pipeline waits for the scan to complete. You can configure rules to automatically fail the build if important or high-severity vulnerabilities are found.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReport and remediate: Scan results are pushed to developers through integrated ticketing systems (like Jira or Linear) or directly in their Git platform. The provides immediate, actionable feedback.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Start small and iterate\\nYou don\u2019t need to automate everything at once. Begin with one or two important applications. Use this initial implementation to learn and fine-tune the process. Configure the scanner to look for a limited set of high-impact vulnerabilities, like the OWASP Top 10.\\nAs your team becomes more comfortable with the workflow, you can expand the scope of the scans and roll out the automation to more applications. The iterative approach minimises disruption and helps build momentum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Optimise scans for the pipeline\\nA full DAST scan can take hours, which is too long for a typical CI/CD pipeline. To avoid delays, optimise your scanning strategy:\\nIncremental scans: Configure scans to test only the parts of the application that have changed since the last build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargeted scans: Focus scans on specific vulnerability classes that are most relevant to your application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsynchronous scans: For more comprehensive scans, run them asynchronously (out-of-band) from the main CI/CD pipeline. For example, you can trigger a nightly scan on the staging environment. The results can be reviewed the next day without blocking deployments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe future is automated\\nIn a world where software is constantly evolving, security must keep pace. Manual DAST scanning is a relic of a slower era of software development. It creates bottlenecks, lacks scalability, and places an unnecessary burden on engineering teams.\\nBy automating DAST and integrating it into the CI/CD pipeline, you transform security from a barrier into an enabler. It allows your team to build and deploy secure software quickly and confidently. For any engineering or DevOps professional looking to enhance their organisation\u2019s security posture without sacrificing speed, automating DAST is no longer just a best practice \u2013 it\u2019s a necessity.\\nImage source: Unsplash\\nThe post The engineer\u2019s guide to automating DAST tools appeared first on AI News.","dc:creator":"Bazoom","description":"<p>In modern software development, speed and security must go hand in hand.

If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that&rsquo;s a strong signal.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Local testing</strong>: Test your MCP server before publishing using the<a href=\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector\\"> MCP Inspector</a>. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Agent synergy</strong>: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>Tool overload fix</strong>: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won&rsquo;t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub&rsquo;s much more manageable.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"wp-block-heading\\" id=\\"whats-next\\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started. Here&rsquo;s a look at what&rsquo;s on the horizon&mdash;from self-publication to enterprise adoption&mdash;so you can see where the ecosystem is heading.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\"wp-block-list\\">\\n<li><strong>Self-publication</strong>: Expected in the next couple months. This will unlock community-driven growth and make the registry the canonical source for all public MCP servers.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li><strong>More IDE support</strong>: Other IDEs are coming.

The cereal is scattered across three aisles. The milk is hiding in some random cooler near self-checkout. And those produce labels? They haven\u2019t been updated in months.\\nThat\u2019s exactly what discovering Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers felt like. Until now.\\nAs a refresher, MCP is how developers connect tools, APIs, and workflows to their AI systems. Each MCP server is like an ingredient in your AI stack, whether it\u2019s Playwright for browser automation, Notion for knowledge access, or GitHub\u2019s own MCP server with over a hundred tools.\xa0\\nThe new GitHub MCP Registry changes everything by giving you a single, canonical source for discovering, installing, and managing MCP servers right on GitHub.\\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about finding the right tools for your AI stack, publishing your own servers, and setting up governance for your team.\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll walk through how to:\\nInstall an MCP server\\nPublish your own\\nEnable governance and team use\\nWe\u2019ll also share a few tips and tricks for power users. Let\u2019s go!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\u2019s in the registry today\\nCurrently, the GitHub MCP Registry has 44 MCP servers, including:\\nPlaywright: Automate and test web apps.\\nGitHub MCP server: Access 100+ GitHub API tools.\\nContext7, MarkItDown (Microsoft), Terraform (HashiCorp).\\nPartner servers from Notion, Unity, Firecrawl, Stripe, and more.\\nYou can browse by tags, popularity, or GitHub stars to find the tools you need.\\nHow to install an MCP server\\nThe registry makes installation a one-click experience in VS Code or VS Code Insiders.\\nExample: Installing Playwright\\nNavigate to Playwright MCP server in the GitHub MCP Registry.\\nClick Install in VS Code.\\nVS Code launches with a pre-filled configuration.\\nAccept or adjust optional parameters (like storage paths).\\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready to use Playwright in your agentic workflows.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Remote MCP servers (like GitHub\u2019s) use OAuth during install so you don\u2019t need to manually handle tokens or secrets. Just authenticate once and start building.\\nHow to publish your own MCP server\\n1. Install the MCP Publisher CLI\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (Homebrew, recommended):\\nbrew install mcp-publisher\\nmacOS/Linux/WSL (prebuilt binary, latest version):\\n\\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher && sudo mv mcp-publisher /usr/local/bin/\\n2. Initialize your server.json file\\nNavigate to your server\u2019s source directory and run:\\ncd /path/to/your/mcp-server\\nmcp-publisher init\\nThis creates a server.json file. Example:\\n{\\n  \\"$schema\\": \\"https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-09-29/server.schema.json\\",\\n  \\"name\\": \\"io.github.yourname/your-server\\",\\n  \\"title\\": \\"Describe Your Server\\",\\n  \\"description\\": \\"A description of your MCP server\\",\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n  \\"packages\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"registryType\\": \\"npm\\",\\n      \\"identifier\\": \\"your-package-name\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\",\\n      \\"transport\\": { \\"type\\": \\"stdio\\" }\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n3. Prove you own the package\\nAdd the required metadata for your package type.\\nNPM: Add an \\"mcpName\\" field to your package.json:\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"your-npm-package\\",\\n  \\"mcpName\\": \\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n}\\nPyPI/NuGet: Add this to your README:\\nmcp-name: io.github.username/server-name\\nDocker: Add a label to your Dockerfile:\\nLABEL io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name=\\"io.github.username/server-name\\"\\n4. Authentication\\nFor GitHub-based namespaces (io.github.*), run:\\nmcp-publisher login github\\n       This will open a browser for OAuth login.\\nFor custom domains (com.yourcompany/*), follow DNS verification steps in the official docs.\\n5. Publish your server\\nOnce authenticated, publish to the registry:\\nmcp-publisher publish\\nIf successful, your server will be discoverable in the MCP registry. You can verify with:\\ncurl \\"https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=io.github.yourname/your-server\\"\\nOnce you\u2019ve completed the steps above, email\xa0partnerships@github.com\xa0and request for your server to be included.\\n\u2705 Pro tips:\xa0\\nNamespace: Use io.github.username/* for GitHub auth, or com.yourcompany/* for DNS-based verification.\\nRemote endpoints: Add a \\"remotes\\" array in your server.json for cloud/HTTP endpoints:\\n\\"remotes\\": [\\n  {\\n    \\"type\\": \\"streamable-http\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://yourdomain.com/yourserver\\"\\n  }\\n]\\nMultiple deployment options: You can list both \\"packages\\" and \\"remotes\\" for hybrid deployments.\\nExamples: See airtable-mcp-server (npm/docker/MCPB), time-mcp-nuget, time-mcp-pypi.\\nAutomate publishing with GitHub Actions\\nYou can automate publishing so every tagged release is published to both your package registry and the MCP registry.\\nCreate .github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml:\\nname: Publish to MCP Registry\\non:\\n  push:\\n    tags: [\\"v*\\"]\\n\\njobs:\\n  publish:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    permissions:\\n      id-token: write  # For OIDC\\n      contents: read\\n\\n    steps:\\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\\n\\n      # (Edit these for your package type)\\n      - name: Setup Node.js\\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v5\\n        with:\\n          node-version: \\"lts/*\\"\\n      - name: Install dependencies\\n        run: npm ci\\n      - name: Build and test\\n        run: |\\n          npm run build --if-present\\n          npm run test --if-present\\n      - name: Publish to npm\\n        run: npm publish\\n        env:\\n          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\\n\\n      # MCP publishing (works for all package types)\\n      - name: Download MCP Publisher\\n        run: |\\n          curl -L \\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/latest/mcp-publisher_$(uname -s | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\')_$(uname -m | sed \'s/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/\').tar.gz\\" | tar xz mcp-publisher\\n      - name: Publish to MCP Registry\\n        run: |\\n          ./mcp-publisher login github-oidc\\n          ./mcp-publisher publish\\n\\n      # Optional: keep server.json version in sync with git tag\\n      - run: |\\n          VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}\\n          jq --arg v \\"$VERSION\\" \'.version = $v\' server.json > tmp && mv tmp server.json\\nTo trigger the workflow:\\ngit tag v1.0.0\\ngit push origin v1.0.0\\nWhen you publish, your server shows up in the open source registry and downstream registries (like GitHub\u2019s) automatically pick up updates. No more notifying a dozen different registries every time you ship a new version.\\n\u2705 Pro tips:\\nHost your code in a public GitHub repository to show verified ownership.\\nAdd tags in server.json so developers can easily discover your server by category.\\nUpdates propagate automatically downstream\u2014no manual notifications required\\nHow to manage MCP servers in the enterprise\\nIf you\u2019re managing MCP usage across a large organization, governance isn\u2019t optional. You need control over which servers your developers can install\u2014especially when those servers interact with sensitive data.\\nGitHub now supports registry allow lists so admins can control which MCP servers are available to developers.\\nHere are the steps for admins (which may be you!):\\nStand up or connect an internal registry that follows the MCP API spec (registry + HTTP endpoint).\\nAdd vetted MCP servers (internal + external) to your registry.\\nPoint GitHub Enterprise settings to that registry endpoint.\\nMCP-aware surfaces (starting with VS Code) enforce the allow list automatically.\\nExample: How the allow list works\\nYour internal registry at https://internal.mybank.com/mcp-registry returns:\\n{\\n  \\"servers\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/github/mcp-server\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.0.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"github.com/microsoft/markitdown-mcp\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"2.1.0\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"internal.mybank.com/mcp-servers/custom-tools\\",\\n      \\"version\\": \\"1.5.0\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\nWhen developers try to install an MCP server in VS Code, GitHub checks your registry endpoint and only allows installations from your approved list.\\nThis governance model means you can vet partnerships, run security scans, and maintain compliance, all while giving developers access to the tools they need.\\n\u2705 Pro tip: Use GitHub\u2019s API or your existing security pipeline to vet MCP servers before adding them to your allow list.\\nTips and tricks for power users\\nOnce you\u2019ve got the basics down, here are some shortcuts to get more out of the registry:\\nSort smarter: Use GitHub stars and org verification to quickly assess quality and legitimacy. If a server has thousands of stars and comes from a verified org like Microsoft or HashiCorp, that\u2019s a strong signal.\\nLocal testing: Test your MCP server before publishing using the MCP Inspector. This helps you catch issues early without polluting the registry.\xa0\\nAgent synergy: Copilot coding agent comes preloaded with GitHub and Playwright MCP servers. This combo enables auto-generated pull requests with screenshots of web apps, perfect for UI-heavy projects where visual validation matters.\\nTool overload fix: VS Code is rolling out semantic tool lookups, so your agent won\u2019t flood contexts with 90+ tools. Instead, only the relevant ones surface based on your prompt. This makes working with large MCP servers like GitHub\u2019s much more manageable.\\nWhat\u2019s next?\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry is just getting started. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s on the horizon\u2014from self-publication to enterprise adoption\u2014so you can see where the ecosystem is heading.\\nSelf-publication: Expected in the next couple months. This will unlock community-driven growth and make the registry the canonical source for all public MCP servers.\\nMore IDE support: Other IDEs are coming. The goal is to make MCP server installation seamless regardless of where you write code.\\nEnterprise features: Governance flows to help unlock MCP usage in regulated industries. Think financial services, healthcare, and other sectors where compliance isn\u2019t negotiable.\\nAgentic workflows: GitHub MCP server will start bundling tools into use-case-driven flows (e.g., \u201canalyze repository + open pull request\u201d) instead of just exposing raw API endpoints. This will make complex workflows feel like simple commands.\\nGet started today\\nThe GitHub MCP Registry has 44 servers today and will continue growing (trust us!).\\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore the MCP Registry on GitHub\\n\ud83d\udc49 To nominate your server now, email partnerships@github.com.\\nSoon, this registry will become the single source of truth for MCP servers, giving you one place to discover, install, and govern tools without hopping across outdated registries.\\nThe future of AI-assisted development isn\u2019t about coding faster. It\u2019s about orchestrating tools that amplify your impact.

With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8.

The vessel also made a mandatory stop in Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) for Yemen before sailing on to the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\xa0\\nThe majority of UN member states have repeatedly voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. UNVIM told Bellingcat: \u201cAs a UN mandated body UNVIM does not have the authority to block shipments based on unilateral national or regional sanctions.\u201d They added: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.\u201d\\nHowever, experts have previously highlighted to Bellingcat that even with the limitations of that remit the fact that grain shipments from occupied Ukrainian territories are passing through UN inspection mechanism creates an awkward situation.\\nBellingcat mapped Irtysh\u2019s journey by combining Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence and satellite analysis. During the investigation, two additional vessels were also identified with their tracking systems disabled while loading grain in Sevastopol: Matros Pozynich (IMO: 9573816) and Zafar (IMO: 9720263).\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n                \\n\\n            \\n 2025-08-07 14:27\\n            \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nBlack Sea\\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nEgypt: Suez Canal\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nPort of Djibouti: UNVIM Inspection\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nHouthi-controlled Yemen: Port of Saleef\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\nBosphorus Strait\\n\\n Credit: Y\xf6r\xfck I\u015f\u0131k \\nBlack Sea\\nOccupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust over a month after Irtysh was first seen loading grain at the Port of Sevastopol, Bellingcat identified another Russian vessel, Matros Pozynich, at the same berth. Previously identified by CNN in 2022 for exporting grain from occupied Ukraine, and by Bellingcat the following year, the vessel was docked at the Avlita grain terminal on Sept. 20.\\nTwo days later, Matros Pozynich switched its AIS back on before sailing through the Bosphorus Strait, just as Irtysh had. With its hull sitting low in the water, the vessel was photographed passing through Turkish waters seemingly fully laden.\\nAfter calling at Djibouti, likely for inspection by UNVIM, AIS data shows the bulk carrier departing for Saleef, Yemen, on Oct. 8. At time of publication, Matros Pozynich remains in anchorage off the Port of Saleef, Yemen.\\n\\n            \\n                \\nDocked at Port of Sevastopol\\nSept. 20, 2025\\n\\n2025 Vantor\\n                    \\nFully Laden in Bosphorus Strait\\nSept. 23, 2025\\n\\nAt Anchor in Djibouti\\nOct. 5, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\nAt Anchor in Port of Saleef\\nOct. 14, 2025\\n\\nPlanet Labs PBC\\n                \\n\\nA third vessel, also previously implicated for smuggling grain, Zafar, was captured by satellite imagery with its AIS turned off at the Port of Sevastopol from Sept. 23.\\n\\nAvlita grain terminal, Port of Sevastopol, Sept. 23\u201325.

Instead, it was anchored off the Port of Alexandria, Egypt \u2013 another known location for offloading grain from occupied Ukraine, according to OCCRP reporting.\\n\u201cGrain Theft\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine has repeatedly tried to dissuade countries from purchasing shipments loaded with what it describes as stolen grain from occupied regions.\xa0\\nThe Port of Sevastopol and the Avlita grain terminal remain under European, UK and US sanctions. While no UN sanctions specifically target the port, a majority of UN member states have passed resolutions condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and of its occupation of Crimea since 2024.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Irtysh and Matros Pozynich delivered grain to the Houti-controlled Port of Saleef via Djibouti \u2013 the UNVIM inspection point for Yemen. After ten years of war, the UNHCR reports that tens of thousands of people in Yemen are living in famine-like conditions, with a further five million people experiencing food insecurity.\\nUNVIM confirmed to Bellingcat that the Irtysh was inspected \u201cin line with UNVIM operational protocols\u201d on Sept. 7 and cleared by the Saudi-led coalition Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Cell (EHOC) \u2013 a body entirely separate from the UN \u2013 on Sept. 8.\\nAsked whether UNVIM was aware the vessel had picked up grain from a port under Western sanctions, the agency replied: \u201cThe UNVIM mandate is limited to verifying compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions related to Yemen.

However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich&#8217;s calls for donations.

He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don&#8217;t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don&#8217;t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said.

Although the first recorded use of him as Romanov is from the period between 2020 and 2022, we will refer to him as such throughout most of the story for consistency.\\nIn September 2019, a 21-year-old man named Vladislav Gillung registered as a candidate for Russia\u2019s municipal elections in the city of St. Petersburg.\\nTweets by the former campaign leader for the anti-corruption activist and opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, show that Gillung was attempting to run as part of the movement opposing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\xa0\\nThe local electoral committee refused his candidacy. However, only weeks later, he seemed to have switched sides as he attended an event for the pro-Putin United Russia party.\\nVladislav Gillung has since changed his name to Vladislav Romanov and became close to Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that is under western sanctions. Rusich members have been accused of, and co-founder Yan Petrovsky convicted of, war crimes.\xa0\\nAn investigation by Bellingcat has tracked Romanov from these early days in St. Petersburg, finding that he appears to have assisted in Rusich\u2019s fundraising and business activities. He has even been pictured near the front line in eastern Ukraine.\\nRomanov\u2019s bank number has appeared in Rusich\u2019s calls for donations. On top of this, he is listed as the person selling Rusich merchandise on a Russian webstore.\\nThe money Rusich makes in these ventures helps fund its operations, according to experts Bellingcat spoke to.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport Bellingcat\\nYour donations directly contribute to our ability to publish groundbreaking investigations and uncover wrongdoing around the world.\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Bellingcat reached out to Romanov via email, he said that he joined Navalny\u2019s movement because he \u201cwanted to go into politics and represent the interests of society\u201d. He also acknowledged helping run Rusich\u2019s online store but denied working for the group. \u201cI don\u2019t work with Rusich. They just asked someone with experience and education to take over their store, and I helped them out without pay. I don\u2019t see anything special about it,\u201d Romanov said. There is no suggestion that he has been directly involved in the violent activities other members of the group have been accused of or found guilty of, nor has he been placed under international sanctions or been accused in any criminal cases related to the group.\\nDenis Mikhailov, a Navalny campaign leader for the 2019 municipal elections, said that he recalled Romanov. Mikhailov told Bellingcat that Romanov was a \u201creserved and well-mannered guy\u201d, who \u201calways listened more than he talked\u201d.\\nBut it soon became apparent after the elections that their views differed on a number of subjects. \u201cWe talked about Ukraine, and he expressed that he sympathises with the so-called LPR/DPR,\u201d breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Mikhailov said.\\nMikhailov has since left Russia as pressure on those connected to the now deceased Navalny (who was poisoned by Russian secret service agents in 2020 and died in prison in 2024) has increased. He was not aware that Romanov had moved towards United Russia, but he said he was not entirely surprised by this turn of events. \u201cI don\u2019t remember [Romanov\u2019s] exact words, but, in addition to the topic of Ukraine, he said something about Putin\u2019s system being the only way to build a political career.\u201d\\nWhen asked why he left the opposition movement, Romanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cbecame very disappointed in the ideas of Navalny and his team\u201d, because they worked \u201cto destabilise Russia\u201d.\\nJust two months after the 2019 municipal elections, Romanov was pictured at an event where the branding of the youth wing of the United Russia party was clearly visible.\\n\\nVladislav Romanov (centre) in a picture posted by Monika Pakhomi (left) on Nov. 8, 2019. There is a media wall behind them with two logotypes of the Young Guard of United Russia organisation (United Russia\u2019s youth wing). The date the picture was posted coincides with a party congress that took place in St. Petersburg. Source: Monika Pakhomi\u2019s VK Account.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that he \u201cused to be a member of both the youth wing and the United Russia party itself\u201d.\xa0\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a member for three years now, as politics no longer interests me. I prefer my profession\u201d as a businessman, he said.\\nThe people he posed with at the event included Monika Pakhomi, a council member of St. Petersburg\u2019s Izmailovskoe district. According to the council\u2019s website and VK page, Pakhomi was awarded a medal for her work supporting the occupation of Ukraine by the regional All-Russia People\u2019s Front \u2013 an organisation under European Union sanctions. Pakhomi did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThis image allowed Bellingcat to search for and identify further pictures of Romanov available online.\\nOne image posted to Twitter, now known as X, showed him armed and alongside prominent Rusich fighters, including Yan Petrovsky (who has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court) and the Russian nationalist politician, chairman of the Rodina party, Alexey Zhuravlev (currently under international sanctions), in the formerly occupied city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\xa0Bellingcat had previously reported on Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Izyum without realising that Romanov had accompanied him there.\\n\\nAn image from Zhuravlev\u2019s trip to Ukraine, taken in Izyum in May 2022. From left to right: Timur \u201cKiba\u201d Gromov, Alexey Zhuravlev, Vladislav Romanov and Yan Petrovsky. Source: X/Twitter.\\nWhen Bellingcat asked him about the trip, Romanov said that he spent two days with Alexey Zhuravlev in Izyum, \u201cto deliver humanitarian aid to the residents\u201d, and the \u201cLPR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] fighters gave Alexey and me automatic weapons for a couple of photos, and we took pictures as a souvenir\u201d. \\nHe added that selection for the trip was handled by his university in conjunction with the Youth Parliament of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, which is why Zhuravlev was there.\u201d Bellingcat sought to confirm this with Romanov\u2019s university, the St.Petersburg State University of Economics, but did not receive a response before publication.\xa0\\nWhen asked if he ever fought in Ukraine, Romanov said: \u201cI never fought due to lack of training.\u201d He also claimed that he \u201cnever joined Rusich\u201d. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no military skills, so even if I wanted to join, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a businessman,\u201d he said in messages over email.\\nRusich\u2019s Merchandise Man\\nRusich is a paramilitary group that has been an active force in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Several of its fighters have been involved in Wagner operations in places like Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic. \\n\\nSubscribe to the Bellingcat newsletter\\nSubscribe to our newsletter for first access to our published content and events that our staff and contributors are involved with, including  interviews and training workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne former commander and founding member, Yan Petrovsky, has been convicted of war crimes by a Finnish court and another, Alexey Milchakov, has been implicated in war crimes.\\nThe organisation and its leaders are under international sanctions, and so are some of its cryptocurrency wallets, but many people associated with Rusich are still largely unknown to the public. Vladislav Romanov was \u2013 until now \u2013 one of those it appears has been operating behind the scenes.\xa0\\nIn the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the group claimed to Meduza that it had an IT and a Financial department that organised fundraisers and donations from supporters and was also active in cybercrime.\\nOn April 2, 2024, Rusich posted a message on Telegram stating that it was funded solely through organised fundraising and advertising.\\n\\nThe Rusich message claiming they are funded through donations, advertisements and announcing plans to launch their own sports nutrition brand. Source: Telegram/Rusich.\\nYet they now also sell their own products as well, including protein powders, key chains and Alexey Milchakov sticker packs.\\nJonathan Deer, who has researched Rusich at the New America think tank, told Bellingcat it was common for Rusich to say, \u201c\u2018We need XYZ and we need it in this amount. We are requesting that you either donate the item itself or donate to us at this card number\u2019\u201d. Though this still happens, Deer thinks calls for donations have become less frequent.\\nRusich runs its own site to assist with merchandise operations, but it uses Ozon.ru, a Russian webshop, as well. The seller on the Rusich Ozon page is listed as Vladislav Konstaninovich Romanov, with goods shipped from St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOn Ozon.ru, if you hover the mouse over the information icon next to the store name, you can view more information about the seller (whether or not it is a person or a legal entity). In this case, it is Vladislav Konstantinovich Romanov\u2019s full name. Source: Screenshot from Ozon.ru.\\nBellingcat looked for this name online and found four individuals in a leaked Alfa-Bank database (Alfa-Bank is one of the largest private banks in Russia, currently under EU and US sanctions).\\nOne of these individuals was the owner of a card number ending in 1073. This same card number, it transpires, appeared in messages from an old Rusich Telegram channel. Although that channel no longer exists, some messages were archived on TGStat, a web-based analytics tool for Telegram, such as this one from 2022.\\n\\nNumber and contact details for Romanov, except for the first four and last four digits of his card number.\\nIn the messages, benefactors were instructed to donate using crypto or to just transfer money to the Alfa-Bank card number that matched Romanov\u2019s (ending in 1073).\\n\\nAn old Rusich call for donation, forwarded by former Rusich fighter Evgeny \u201cTopaz\u201d Rasskazov. The Alfa-Bank card number matches Romanov\u2019s card number.\\nA message on September 9, 2022, stated Rusich had collected 900,000 Rubles (at that time US $14,805). Two days later, they claimed to have received 1.2 million Rubles (then $19,740). Both messages list Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account as the place where donations should be sent.\\nIt is not possible to know for sure what Rusich spent the money on. But the September 9 message did say the unit needed a wide variety of equipment.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that an account listing Romanov\u2019s details appears to be handling money for Rusich suggests he is not just a \u201cgrunt\u201d, said Deer of New America. Other open source information gathered by Bellingcat, meanwhile, tied his name to further revenue generating projects.\\nPhone Numbers and Contact Books\\nOn June 9, 2025, the Rusich Telegram channel instructed people to contact an account named \u201crozzkr\u201d for ad-related inquiries. Similarly, messages sent to the Rusich Telegram channel receive an automated response asking those who want to advertise with them to contact rozzkr, their \u201cmanager\u201d. Rozzkr appears to be connected to one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers, which ends in 0663, and was visible in several leaked databases.\\n\\nA screenshot from TGStat.ru, showing the old description of the Rusich channel before it was changed. TGStat.ru allows you to look up old channel descriptions.\\n\\nA screenshot from the Poisks Cheloveka Naytis Telegram bot showing the username history for rozzkr and three phone numbers once associated with the account. There are several Telegram bots that allow you to look up someone\u2019s account history.\\nAccording to the 2022 Yandex Food data leak, for example, a Yandex Food account with this name and number was used in December 2021.\\nThe rozzkr Telegram account itself contains little detail. It includes a first name that consists only of numbers, an anonymised profile picture and a seemingly random location. The account owner also added a standard message for all empty chats: an image of Alexey Milchakov in camouflage uniform and some accompanying text that says it costs 100,000 Rubles to place an ad in their Telegram channel.\\n\\nA screenshot of the default message on rozzkr\u2019s Telegram channel, giving the price for advertising with Rusich.\\nPrice information from the rozzkr account is consistent with what Rusich posted on Jan. 27, 2024, where they said the money would be used for the group\u2019s needs.\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that the number ending in 0663 was \u201cindeed an old phone number registered\u201d to him. But he said that in \u201caround 2017-2018\u201d\xa0 one of his \u201cacquaintances\u201d asked to borrow his SIM card to register a work Telegram account. \u201cJudging by everything, this is the one,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know that \u201cthis number was still active\u201d and that he had no idea \u201cwho currently owns the @rozzkr account on Telegram\u201d. Bellingcat tried to call the number and it did now appear to be inactive.\\nRomanov did not share who he gave the SIM card to or detail why or how the phone number continued to be used in his name after 2018.\\n\\nData from the Yandex.Food leak under the name of Vladislav Gillung. The phone number matches that for @rozzkr and the email address matches the one from Romanov\u2019s Alfa-Bank account. The \u201ccreated_at\u201d column shows activity on the app in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther leaks also show a Vladislav Konstantovich Romanov provided the same phone number to a Russian courier service (CDEK) in 2021 and 2022.\\nInterestingly, Bellingcat also noticed on the Sherlock Telegram bot that another number linked to the rozzkr account was used for mobile banking by someone named Vladislav Konstantinovich R \u2013 this aligns with Romanov\u2019s first name, patronymic and the first letter of his surname.\\nBellingcat asked Romanov about the second number linked to the account and called the number itself. The number appeared to now be disconnected and Romanov did not respond to further questions about this before publication.\\nLeaked data from ZAGS (\u0417\u0410\u0413\u0421), Russia\u2019s civil registration, shows that Gillung legally changed his name to Romanov. Romanov said his parents divorced in his childhood and that Gillung is his mother\u2019s surname. He decided to take on his father\u2019s surname \u201cas is customary in Russia\u201d.\\n\\nVladislav Konstantinovich Gillung changed his surname to Romanov. Source: ZAGS leak via the Sherlock Telegram bot.\\nRomanov can also be directly linked to Rusich-leader, Alexey Milchakov, through a phone number both appeared to use at least once.\\nMilchakov shows up multiple times in a data leak from the courier service, CDEK, often using a phone number ending in 386. The same number also appears with two other names in the CDEK leak: Anton Yakovlev and Vladislav Konstantinovich Gillung (Romanov\u2019s previous legal name).\\nRomanov told Bellingcat that \u201cAlexey [Milchakov], an old acquaintance of mine, once asked me to pick up a parcel for him when he was away.\u201d\\nA Facebook leak shows that Milchakov used that number to create his now-deleted Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove: screenshot from Intelx.io showing Milchakov\u2019s phone number in the Facebook data leak. Source: intelx.io. Below: Facebook data leak in Bellingcat\u2019s database.\\nPeople using Numbuster and GetContact, meanwhile, tagged the same phone number as belonging to Milchakov.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth screenshots depict Numbuster results for Milchakov\u2019s phone number ending in 386. Tags include his famous nickname \u201cSerb\u201d, but also \u201cAlexey Yuryevich\u201d (his name and patronymic) and \u201cSerb Milchakov Alexey\u201d.\\nContact book apps like these harvest data from users\u2019 phones and have been used in many investigations, such as Bellingcat\u2019s Berlin Tiergarten assassination investigation (where Numbuster and GetContact were used) and the investigation into the death of Colombian protestor, Lucas Villa (where TrueCaller was used).\\nIn Numbuster, one of Romanov\u2019s phone numbers (ending in 663 and that he used for his Yandex Food account) is tagged as \u201cVlad United Russia St. Petersburg Youth Politics\u201d.\\n\\nThe first two entries list Romanov\u2019s name as Vladislav Gillung. The bottom entry reads, Vlad United Russia St Petersburg Youth Politics. Source: Numbuster.\\nAsked how he met Milchakov, Romanov claimed that they met at a gun shop in St. Petersburg when he was buying his hunting rifle.\\nBellingcat contacted Rusich before publication to ask about the details in this story but did not receive a response.\\nAiganysh Aidarbekova contributed to this report for Bellingcat.\\nBellingcat is a non-profit and the ability to carry out our work is dependent on the kind support of individual donors.

October\u2019s Patch Tuesday also marks the final month that Microsoft will ship security updates for Windows 10 systems. If you\u2019re running a Windows 10 PC and you\u2019re unable or unwilling to migrate to Windows 11, read on for other options.\\n\\nThe first zero-day bug addressed this month (CVE-2025-24990) involves a third-party modem driver called Agere Modem that\u2019s been bundled with Windows for the past two decades. Microsoft responded to active attacks on this flaw by completely removing the vulnerable driver from Windows.\\nThe other zero-day is CVE-2025-59230, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager (also known as RasMan), a service used to manage remote network connections through virtual private networks (VPNs) and dial-up networks.\\n\u201cWhile RasMan is a frequent flyer on Patch Tuesday, appearing more than 20 times since January 2022, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen it exploited in the wild as a zero day,\u201d said Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable.\\nNarang notes that Microsoft Office users should also take note of CVE-2025-59227 and CVE-2025-59234, a pair of remote code execution bugs that take advantage of \u201cPreview Pane,\u201d meaning that the target doesn\u2019t even need to open the file for exploitation to occur. To execute these flaws, an attacker would social engineer a target into previewing an email with a malicious Microsoft Office document.\\nSpeaking of Office, Microsoft quietly announced this week that Microsoft Word will now automatically save documents to OneDrive, Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. Users who are uncomfortable saving all of their documents to Microsoft\u2019s cloud can change this in Word\u2019s settings; ZDNet has a useful how-to on disabling this feature.\\nKev Breen, senior director of threat research at Immersive, called attention to CVE-2025-59287, a critical remote code execution bug in the Windows Server Update Service\xa0 (WSUS) \u2014 the very same Windows service responsible for downloading security patches for Windows Server versions. Microsoft says there are no signs this weakness is being exploited yet. But with a threat score of 9.8 out of possible 10 and marked \u201cexploitation more likely,\u201d CVE-2025-59287 can be exploited without authentication and is an easy \u201cpatch now\u201d candidate.\\n\u201cMicrosoft provides limited information, stating that an unauthenticated attacker with network access can send untrusted data to the WSUS server, resulting in deserialization and code execution,\u201d Breen wrote. \u201cAs WSUS is a trusted Windows service that is designed to update privileged files across the file system, an attacker would have free rein over the operating system and could potentially bypass some EDR detections that ignore or exclude the WSUS service.\u201d\\nFor more on other fixes from Redmond today, check out the SANS Internet Storm Center monthly roundup, which indexes all of the updates by severity and urgency.\\nWindows 10 isn\u2019t the only Microsoft OS that is reaching end-of-life today;\xa0Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Skype for Business 2016, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2, and Outlook 2016 are some of the other products that Microsoft is sunsetting today.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re running any Windows 10 systems, you\u2019ve probably already determined whether your PC meets the technical hardware specs recommended for the Windows 11 OS. If you\u2019re reluctant or unable to migrate a Windows 10 system to Windows 11, there are alternatives to simply continuing to use Windows 10 without ongoing security updates.\\nOne option is to pay for another year\u2019s worth of security updates through Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. The cost is just $30 if you don\u2019t have a Microsoft account, and apparently free if you register the PC to a Microsoft account. This video breakdown from Ask Your Computer Guy does a good job of walking Windows 10 users through this process. Microsoft emphasizes that ESU enrollment does not provide other types of fixes, feature improvements or product enhancements. It also does not come with technical support.\\n\\nIf your Windows 10 system is associated with a Microsoft account and signed in when you visit Windows Update, you should see an option to enroll in extended updates. Image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZH7MlvOoPM\\n\\nWindows 10 users also have the option of installing some flavor of Linux instead. Anyone seriously considering this option should check out the website endof10.org, which includes a plethora of tips and a DIY installation guide.\\nLinux Mint is a great option for Linux newbies. Like most modern Linux versions, Mint will run on anything with a 64-bit CPU that has at least 2GB of memory, although 4GB is recommended. In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.\\nLinux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt.

The development of a second fire, visible in the bottom right-hand corner from the 25th onwards, has not been included. Source: NASA.\\nThe satellite imagery below from Sept. 25 shows burn marks from the fires breaching the park\u2019s northern border, surrounding villages and farmland. Speaking to local media, residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.\xa0\\n\\nPark border outline is breached Sept. 25, with the fire extending further north into farmland by Sept.30. Source: Copernicus.\\nBy Oct. 1, international media reports stated between 7,500 to 8,500 km\xb2 of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat\u2019s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km\xb2 \u2013 more than a third of the national park \u2013 was affected.\xa0\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nInvestigations\\nWhat Can Open Sources Reveal About Beijing\u2019s Deadly Floods?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a vast area of savanna grassland, fires \u2013 often ignited by lightning \u2013 are a natural part of the park\u2019s ecosystem, says Prof. Theo Wassenaar, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.\xa0\\n\u201cSavanna without fires is not a savanna\u201d says Prof. Wassenaar. But \u201cthis Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,\u201d he says \u2013 \u201ca gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)\u201d.\xa0\\nThe Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.\\nHowever, in a public release the Ministry said: \u201cThe wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia\u2019s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.\\nOrigins of the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires \u201cbegan on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.\u201d\\nNASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister\u2019s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park\u2019s south-western borders. As seen below, NASA FIRMS employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.\\n\\nNASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park\u2019s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source: NASA FIRMS.\\nFurther analysis of the yellow square\u2019s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via Zoom.Earth, also supports this, with the fire\u2019s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.\\nGoogle Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.\\n\\nCharcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source: Google Earth.\\nThe Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat\u2019s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.\\nCasualties of the Fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park, an image of an injured elephant, badly burned, began circulating on social media.\\n\\nPosted Sept. 30 to Facebook. Credit: Koos Reyneke.\\nIn response to a flurry of commentators challenging the authenticity of the image, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel, told reporters at a press conference they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses \u2013 identified by government helicopters monitoring the area \u2013 were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.\xa0\\nIn an interview with a local news outlet, Network Media Hub, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole \u201cjust before Charl Marais Dam.\u201d Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to Ozonjuitji m\u2019 Bari, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.\\n\\nTop: Facebook post by Koos Reyneke featuring a burned elephant (left).

Termite mounds can take years to build and may last for hundreds of years. Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.\\nShadow analysis using SunCalc \u2013 a tool that helps users analyse the position of the sun and shadows to estimate the time an image was taken \u2013 lined up with the photographer\u2019s statement that the photos, including that of the injured elephant, were captured at around noon on Sept. 28.\\n\\nZooming in on a photo of a jackal with a clearly visible shadow, SunCalc estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal\u2019s height.

Source: Facebook, TV Paju\xe7ara / YouTube\\nAn Australian pilot who recently died when his small plane crashed in South America during a failed drug run has links to an alleged Kinahan cartel associate who is facing charges over the importation of a multimillion dollar cocaine shipment to Western Australia.\\nThe body of former Melbourne stockbroker Timothy James Clark was reportedly found at the wreckage of his single-engine Sling 4 in Brazil\u2019s north-east on September 14, along with about 200kg of cocaine. \\n\\nLeft: the wreckage of the small aircraft in a sugarcane field in Coruripe; Timothy Clark\u2019s drivers licence. Right: cocaine seized by police. Source: Pol\xedcia Militar de Alagoas via G1\\nLocal media said Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.\\nMelbourne newspaper The Age reported on Thursday that Clark\u2019s failed mission in South America was not his \u201cfirst rodeo\u201d and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.\\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) charged German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\\n\\nInsert: German national Oliver Herrmann. Top left: The Overlander Airport, where he allegedly met an aircraft on Dec 27, 2024. Bottom left: cocaine seized by the AFP. Right: Herrmann after he was detained. Source: Facebook / Oliver Herrmann, Google Street View, AFP\\nRelated articles by Bellingcat\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\nNowhere to Run: The Online Footprint of an Alleged Kinahan Cartel Associate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHerrmann had allegedly met a \u201csmall aircraft\u201d at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.\\nInvestigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an \u201corganised crime syndicate\u201d was likely responsible for the scheme.\\nIn March, Bellingcat published an open source analysis of Herrmann\u2019s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group.\\n\\nCrime boss Christy Kinahan and his sons Daniel Kinahan and Christopher Kinahan Jr have a collective US $15 million bounty on their heads.\xa0\\nIt followed reporting by our publishing partner The Sunday Times, which revealed that Herrmann had \u201cclose financial ties\u201d to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.\xa0\\nBellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who said on a couchsurfing website that he loved to \u201cparty hard\u201d, pictured with friends at a \u201cBBQ party\u201d in 2015. Source: Timothy Clark\u2019s Facebook\\nUsing online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.\\nThis open source review shows that the Australian pilot \u2013 who used the moniker \u201cThe Broker\u201d on X and Instagram \u2013 documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.\\nClark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent \u20ac5,500 on \u201cultra topshelf\u201d drinks.\\n\\nTimothy Clark, who was also involved in multiple businesses with interests in energy and mining, frequently posted photos of his overseas travels. Source: Tripadvisor\\nClark was also an associate of Oliver Herrmann; the German businessman\u2019s Facebook profile shows he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the Australian pilot. And a 2018 restaurant review posted by Clark included a photo that shows the pair dining together in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.\xa0\\nThe filename of the photo is dated March 2, the same day that Herrmann logged a run in Harare on the fitness app, Strava. In the same week, Clark posted a review for a Harare bar close to where Herrmann recorded another GPS-tracked run on the same day. \xa0 \xa0\\n\\nAmong his reviews about luxury hotels and wine pairings, Timothy Clark (left) posted a photo with Oliver Herrmann (right) at a restaurant in Harare in 2018. Source: Tripadvisor\\nHerrmann, an acclaimed runner who won the 2016 Munich Marathon, logged more than 2,500 activities across dozens of countries on Strava between 2013 and 2023. His use of the fitness app provided an extensive overview of his travels during that period.\xa0\\nCorporate records show Herrmann has been involved at senior levels with companies active in the fields of fintech, mining and consulting.\\n\\nLocations of runs logged on Herrmann\u2019s Strava account from September 2013 to January 2023. Source: Map data \xa92025 Google, INEGI\\nLike Christy Kinahan, Clark had an active Google Maps profile where he posted reviews, photos and ratings. His profile used the alias \u201cJohn Smithe\u201d, but Clark is pictured in one of the images posted by the account and his real name is used in a reply from one of the venues, confirming it belongs to him.\\nClark also left Tripadvisor reviews for two Zimbabwean venues \u2013 the Amanzi Lodge and Thetford Estate \u2013 which Christy Kinahan later attended, according to the cartel leader\u2019s own Google Maps profile.\\nClark, who lived in South Africa before his death, was also just one of eight X followers of Adam Wood, a known associate of Christy Kinahan in Africa.\\n\\nAdam Wood (left) with cartel leader Christy Kinahan \u2013 known as the \u201cDapper Don\u201d \u2013 at a  2019 aviation conference in Egypt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth African news outlet City Press reported last week that Clark also operated a second aircraft for \u201clegitimate\u201d flights, a Beechcraft King Air 350 with Malawi registration number 7Q-YAO.\\nBellingcat previously revealed that this aircraft was purchased in the US by an Indonesian company linked to Oliver Herrmann\u2019s partner. It was then flown to Southern Africa by a ferry pilot who had also piloted a Pilatus PC-12 previously associated with a Kinahan-linked company.\\nClark posted a Google review for a business at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg on the same day in April 2024 that the Beechcraft King Air 350 landed there, according to tracking data from ADS-B Exchange.\\n\\nTracked flight path of the Beechcraft King Air 350 during its ferry flight from the USA to Africa in February 2024, with numerous subsequent flights also recorded in the region.
