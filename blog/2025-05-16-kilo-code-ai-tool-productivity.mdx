## Why Kilocode?

Kilocode isn’t just another autocomplete tool. It’s a full development partner with specialized modes for every stage of your workflow:

- **Code Mode:** Write and implement features.
- **Architect Mode:** Plan systems before you code.
- **Debug Mode:** Systematically troubleshoot issues.
- **Orchestrator Mode:** Break down complex projects into manageable subtasks—like having your own dev team inside your IDE.

Plus, Kilocode gives you direct access to the latest AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google (including GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro), all at provider cost—no markup, no lock-in, and \$20 in free credits to start.

## Your First Task with Kilocode

Let’s walk through your first AI-powered coding task, step by step:

1. **Choose a Mode:**
Select the mode that matches your goal. For writing code, pick “Code.” For planning, choose “Architect.” For debugging, use “Debug.” For complex projects, try “Orchestrator” to break tasks into subtasks.
2. **Describe Your Task:**
In the chat box, type what you want to build. For example:
> “Create a REST API endpoint in Node.js for user registration.”
3. **Let Kilocode Work:**
Kilocode contacts your chosen AI model, analyzes your request, and proposes a plan or code snippet. You’ll see checkpoints at each step, so you can review, approve, or roll back changes as needed.
4. **Iterate and Refine:**
Use the chat to ask for improvements, explanations, or additional features. Kilocode can reference specific files, external docs, or even your Git history for deeper context.
5. **Run and Test:**
Once you’re happy, run your code directly in VS Code. If you hit a snag, switch to “Debug” mode and let Kilocode help you troubleshoot.
