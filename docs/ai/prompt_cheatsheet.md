# AI Prompt Engineering Cheatsheet: Essential Action Verbs for Better Results

## Abstract

Effective AI prompt engineering requires precise action verbs to eliminate ambiguity and improve output quality. This cheatsheet categorizes 60+ essential verbs across eight functional domains with comparative examples demonstrating improved prompt construction.

## Methodology

Action verbs are categorized by cognitive and operational functions. Each category includes weak versus strong prompt examples demonstrating measurable improvement in specificity and output quality.

## Verb Categories and Applications

### Analysis & Understanding
**Function:** Information examination and interpretation
**Implementation:** Replace vague requests with specific analytical tasks

```
Weak: Tell me about this code
Strong: Analyze this Python function for security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks
```

### Creation & Generation  
**Function:** Novel content and solution development
**Implementation:** Specify deliverable type, constraints, and success criteria

```
Weak: Make a website layout
Strong: Design a responsive landing page layout for SaaS product with hero section, feature highlights, and CTA buttons
```

### Explanation & Teaching
**Function:** Knowledge transfer and conceptual clarification
**Implementation:** Define audience expertise level and learning objectives

```
Weak: What is Docker?
Strong: Explain Docker containerization to a developer familiar with VMs, including key benefits and basic commands
```

### Problem-Solving
**Function:** Issue resolution and optimization
**Implementation:** Identify specific problems and define optimization targets

```
Weak: This code isn't working
Strong: Debug this React component causing infinite re-renders and optimize for performance
```

### Information Processing
**Function:** Data transformation and content manipulation
**Implementation:** Specify input format, desired output, and transformation parameters

```
Weak: Change this text
Strong: Rewrite technical blog post for non-technical audience while preserving key concepts
```

### Reasoning & Logic
**Function:** Evidence-based analysis and conclusion generation
**Implementation:** Request logical frameworks and justification criteria

```
Weak: What do you think will happen?
Strong: Predict microservices implementation outcomes based on current team size and technical constraints
```

### Creative Tasks
**Function:** Original ideation and innovative solution development
**Implementation:** Define creative constraints and evaluation criteria

```
Weak: Give me some ideas
Strong: Brainstorm 10 innovative features for project management tool targeting remote software teams
```

### Research & Discovery
**Function:** Information gathering and synthesis
**Implementation:** Specify scope, sources, and synthesis requirements

```
Weak: Find information about React
Strong: Research React 18 features and compile comparison with React 17 focusing on performance improvements
```

## Optimization Strategies

**Verb Combination:** Layer multiple verbs for complex tasks
```
Analyze user feedback data, categorize issues by severity, generate actionable recommendations
```

**Context Specification:** Include technical constraints and success metrics
```
Optimize database query for high-traffic e-commerce site (10M+ daily users) focusing on read performance
```

## Quick Reference: Complete Verb Taxonomy

| Category | Primary Function | Complete Verb Set |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Analysis & Understanding** | Information examination | analyze, evaluate, examine, interpret, compare, contrast, critique, investigate, diagnose, identify, distinguish, categorize, classify, assess |
| **Creation & Generation** | Content development | create, generate, write, compose, draft, develop, design, formulate, devise, build, synthesize, compile, construct |
| **Explanation & Teaching** | Knowledge transfer | explain, describe, clarify, illustrate, demonstrate, teach, guide, walk through, break down, simplify, elaborate, define, outline, summarize |
| **Problem-Solving** | Issue resolution | solve, troubleshoot, debug, fix, resolve, optimize, improve, refine, streamline, transform, convert, adapt, modify, refactor |
| **Information Processing** | Data manipulation | extract, organize, structure, format, condense, expand, translate, paraphrase, rewrite, edit, revise, fact-check, compile |
| **Reasoning & Logic** | Evidence-based analysis | reason, deduce, infer, conclude, predict, calculate, determine, validate, verify, justify, argue, reflect, chain |
| **Creative Tasks** | Innovation and ideation | brainstorm, imagine, innovate, conceive, invent, reimagine, roleplay, simulate, model, visualize, prototype, storyboard |
| **Research & Discovery** | Information gathering | research, investigate, explore, search, find, discover, trace, track, locate, gather, curate, contextualize |
| **Process & Coordination** | Task management | iterate, prioritize, orchestrate, systematize, decompose, sequence, coordinate, schedule, delegate |

## Claude-Specific Optimizations

**Leveraging Claude's Strengths:**
- **Parallel processing:** Use "orchestrate" for multi-tool coordination
- **Extended context:** Apply "contextualize" for large document analysis  
- **Structured thinking:** Employ "chain" for step-by-step reasoning
- **Reflection capabilities:** Utilize "reflect" for self-assessment and iteration
- **Format control:** Implement "structure" and "format" with XML tags

**Claude-Optimized Verb Combinations:**
```
Analyze this codebase, then decompose the issues by priority, and systematize solutions for each component
```

## Error Prevention

**Common Failures:**
- Vague verb usage ("help me with")
- Multiple conflicting objectives
- Insufficient context specification
- Absence of success criteria

**Mitigation:** Apply specific verbs with defined parameters, constraints, and measurable outcomes.

## Conclusion

Precise verb selection significantly improves AI prompt effectiveness. Implementation of this taxonomy enhances output quality through reduced ambiguity and improved task specification. Claude 4 models respond well to clear, explicit instructions and benefit from structured, specific prompting approaches.
